"1","I am using this controller for Sous Vide Cooking & I love it.  It has proven to do the job very well.  I protect the temperature probe from the water by using a length of 3/8"" soft copper tubing which is pinched and soldered shut on the bottom end.  That allows the probe to sense the temperature without a lag.This unit has allowed me to experience Sous Vide cooking at a low cost because I use it in conjunction with an ordinary 7 quart crock pot.  I gave it four stars only because the instructions are not user friendly.  To help others I have posted photos of the interior mechanism on whysousvide.com.  The photos clearly show where the jumpers are and how to move one of them to use it to control a heating unit rather than a refrigerator.  It's quite simple once you know how.  I also like the long wires as they allow plenty of room to move things around on the counter top.I highly recommend it."
"2","I use this to keep my beer nice and cold inside of a chest freezer. This thing works like a charm.I initially had it simply sitting in the freezer, but I soon realized that the beer was warmer that I needed it to be. I figured out that measuring the air temperature was not the way to go.I wrapped the temperature probe in plastic and submerged it in a bottle of water so that it actually uses the temperature of the liquid instead of the internal air temperature. This allows me to regulate the temperature of the freezer by how cold the liquid is, not how cold the air is.The way that it controls the temperature is by allowing the unit to switch on when it rises above the desired temperature and completely cutting off the electricity when it reaches or falls below the set temperature. Keep this in mind as any lights associated with fridges or freezers will only work when the unit allows power to go to your device."
"3","I purchased this control as an alternative to the stc-1000 controllers that are popular. By the time I would have purchased the stc, along with a project enclosure, switch, fuse, cords, strain relief, I would have had almost as much into it as this unit which was all ready to go. Plus, I would have needed to build it. I needed fahrenheit scale, which this controller has. The directions are written in native english, not chinglish, so are easy to follow. Set up is simple. Two screws open the housing. Then you place the jumper in either the heating or cooling position. You can choose settings easily by hitting ""mode"", and scrolling to the correct parameter with the arrow buttons. You can set temp differential, anti short-cycling time, pre cut off/cut in temps, and of of course cut in and cut off temps. I have this unit hooked up to an ultrasonic cleaner to control its tank heater, and it works really well. The enclosure has four keyhole type screw holes/slots in the back for mounting. This might not apply to you, but keep in mind this is not designed for washdown applications, i.e. it's not water proof. I understand that Johnson does make a unit that is, though."
"4","This unit worked great while it lasted--all 5 months. We used it to convert our chest freezer into a refrigerator for homebrew. I purchased the unit in January 2015, but didn't actually use it until January 2016. It died the end of June. We attempted to contact the manufacturer to see if the warranty was still good and they were extremely rude and unhelpful.A power surge during a storm killed it, lesson learned--plug it into a surge protector. If the customer service had been nicer or more helpful I would have given it more stars but I have never been treated that awful by someone in the goods business. My husband even tried the next day and were equally as awful and unhelpful.Unit=5 starsCustomer service=1 star"
"5","I've been using the Johnson controller for years to convert a chest freezer to a fermentation chamber. I use it year-round for fermenting sake, lagers, and in the summer, ales - so anywhere within the 47-65 degree region. The directions are very straightforward and aside from having to use a screwdriver now and again if you need to change from a cooling device to a heating device, it's very simple to operate. The probe cord is thin enough to allow me to simply slip it over the edge and shut the lid. I haven't found a need to drill a hole.Be mindful that the probe can give off misleading temperatures if it comes into contact with the walls of the freezer or refrigerator. Also the air at the bottom will always be cooler. I arrange the probe so that it comes into contact with the side of my bucket or carboy at  mid-height.I also set the temperature closer to the top of the temperature range (for an ale that prefers temperatures between 62-67, I'll set the controller for 66 or 67. The reason is when the controller reads that ""turn on"" temperature, and the freezer or refrigerator kicks on, it always quickly drops the temperature about 5 degrees before opening the circuit again. The temperature will remain at the colder temperature a good bit longer than it will at the higher temperature."
"6","The first thing you have to do when you get this thing is to open it up and change the jumpers around a little bit, so that it measures heating and not cooling.  This is literally like a 5 minute process.  One or two screws on the back, then both jumpers on.  Check the instructions though.After changing the module from cooling to heating, you have to find something to plug into the temperature controlled outlet.  At first, I used a crock pot, but it took a little too long to heat the water, so I switched to a regular pot, and I bought this cheap water heater: http://smile.amazon.com/NORPRO-559-Immersion-Warming-Liquids/dp/B000I8VE68/ref=sr_1_2?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1391783831&sr=1-2&keywords=Water+HeaterThe water heater is a little bit annoying, but it works okay, in addition to putting the stove on low.  I'd probably spend a little more to get a better water heater next time.Another tip is to try to get the water to your desired temperature before starting everything up.  It'll save a little time.  That's really about it.With the Sous Vide Supreme selling for a little over $200 these days, if I had to do this again, I'd probably just buy the Sous Vide Supreme instead of this home made gadget.  I guess the only ""pro"" about this thing versus a sous vide machine is that it's a lot smaller and easier to store somewhere."
"7","Actually my husband, Michael wrote review:  I have a family heirloom '34 GE Monitor Top fridge running methly formate as the refrigerant.  I remember the unit running as a beer fridge in the 60's in my parents barn.  by the 70's it was relagated to winter paint storage as my dad said it wouldnt run any more.  Brought the fridge to my house where a friend, an HVAC tech, got it running and porcelain cleaned and painted monitor top  for me. Original compressor works with no leaks.  On/off switch would not work, no biggie thats what electrical  plugs do also.  The temp control would turn the compressor on and off but would not vary temps, compressor would stay on for 2 hours or so and cool down to about 30 F in the box, compressor would not come back on till temp hit around 42 F no matter how much I  tried to regulate the temp control settings.  My HVAC buddy was afraid to try to convert the controls due to the old frail  wiring and lack of knowledge about the antique. Restoration companies want thousands of $$$ to convert these things to modern freon, controls etc.I read and researched  about the Johnson unit and figured if it worked could make this MT a reliable 2nd fridge and working conversation piece.  Since I already had a small investment in it another $75 was worth it to try.  Ordered the unit, delivered in about a week during the Chritmas holiday and I had the unit plugged in to set up the control parameters on Dec. 31st.  on New Years day I  installed unit and passed the probe cable through the door molding to test the product. used a piece on thick pliable plastic tubing around cable as to protect the probe cord when the door closed... the MT door is like a vault door and can do a lot of damge to someting caught in between unlike flimsy modern fridge doors.  Hung the probe taped  about halfway down in the box. MT has very small freezer with no door which is essentally the evaporator, since  am not using for a freezer the original temp probe contacting the outsde of the evaporator/ freezer will be overidden by the Johnson unt.  Also, the MT's do not have fans and doors to move air to cool the fridge box, all done by the heavier denser cold air falling down from the evaporator/freezer. The unit retained the parameters I had set the day before.... delay 12 minutes, cut in at 39 F and  cut out at 35 F.  After the initial cycle the unit holds cold 2-3 hours without cycling on again for 20 - 30 minutes to cut out point.  Ambient basement temp is around 65 F.  Instructions were EASY to follow for with even very little technical training.  This past Saturday I felt comfortable enough to drill a temperature probe sized hole through the back of the MT unit to install the probe the correct way.  Got the probe through the outside steel wall, the insulation and the inside steel (not plastic) wall after two attempts through the barely large enough drilled holes.  Siliconed the openings up outside and inside.  So far all is good.  Not afraid to keep  food, beer, pop etc now in this unit.I know this post is long winded but anyone with an old refigerator from the 20's or 30's etc that needs temp control knows how tough it is too find helpful info.  Hope to make that 80 year old compressor last another 80 years since not straining to maintain 10F in the evaporator/freezer."
"8","This unit can be as simple or as complicated as you want it to be.Me? I wanted it to run an older kegerator that had a faulty temperature control. (Some say you shouldn't use this unit as I am, that repair is preferable. But after talking to a few refrigeration techs, using this to cycle it on and off is no different than having the built-in unit do it.) A few moments with the manual will let you know how to set it up. The set-point is the high-end temp, and the differential can be set from there. It defaults to cut out after the differential is reached. For instance, if the set-point is 40 degrees, and differential is 5, it will kick on at 40, and off at 35, so figure your target temperature within that range.And it's a breeze to tweak until you get it set to where you want it.My only con, and it's a small one, is the somewhat large diameter probe wire. I didn't want to drill into the kegerator, so I ran the wire under the door seal. However, while there was a small leak, some foam from a window AC unit plugged it up easily enough. I could have drilled, sure, but I wanted this unit to run the fgeezer I'll convert to a new kegerator when this one gives up the ghost.It's a great price for a dependable, accurate temp controller."
"9","I use these for control of radiant heat panels in reptile cages. Excellent quality controllers. I purchased the pre-wired model just to save me the job of wiring and having to buy over-priced extension cords from Home Depot, and I am glad I did. They use a nice strain relief on this particular item, and the wiring is done correctly. Note: The unit ships setup for cooling operation, where output is energized until the temp is below the setpoint. If using for heating applications, the unit needs to be opened up and two jumpers need to be moved to bridge two pins each. Very easy to do, and the instructions show where. I have seen comments that say the unit does not work for heating, and it is because the jumper change was not done by the end -user. Great product."
"10","My wife likes her refrigerator complete, no freezer.  When ours started to fail, we found a large upright freezer half-price at Sears.  I installed the temperature probe up through the drainage hole and taped it to the middle of the freezer wall, plugged in the controller, set the temp for 36 degrees F and it has been working just fine as a refrigerator.  The better insulated freezer, and the compressor not working hard, we expect to save on our electric bill.The instructions that come with the controller are meant for electricians and more complicated applications than mine, so I searched here among the reviews and found simple instructions to follow and it's easy.If you want to try this, I totally recommend this Johnson controller, just plug it in, no connections."
"11","Bought this to control an upright freezer's temperature for use as a cheese cave. I had concerns about ""programming"" the unit, because I know sometimes these simple interfaces (using only up/down arrows and menu button to navigate) can be overly complicated and confusing, even to someone who knows some computer programming. It took me much more time to understand the terminology and concepts of the unit than to actually program it once I knew what I wanted. Much of my time was spent just figuring out what the unit defaults were (they were set the way I would want them, ""ok that was easy"") and figuring out what settings I wanted to try-- actual programming took perhaps 30 seconds, and was very easy. After a few hours of monitoring, with multiple alternate thermostats, and a little tweaking of my settings, I was (and still am) confident of my environment's temperature.It's simple. Plug in unit. Plug freezer/fridge into plug in unit. Place probe into freezer/fridge. Program unit. Monitor your results and adjust as necessary. Best of all, it works."
"12","This item will control a full size refrigerator or freezer due to the relay being rated at 12 amps.  The display has no illumination so if you want to use this in a dark place bring a flashlight in order to read the temp on the display. You will have to remove the cover to switch the jumpers from heating to cooling mode. I have one of these running a window air conditioner and have had no issues. The temp sensor is NOT waterproof but I have one running a deep freezer for years with no issue so condensation is not a concern but putting the sensor underwater would cause a problem."
"13","Arrived in good shape. It is really easy to program once you have read the instructions.can be used for the control of of heating or cooling devices.Works as described. Best to get one already having the electrical cords mounted on it. They are much better quality than a cheap extension cord which others say to cut up and use.Instructions can be hard to read for some I am told. Don't panic.Just plug it in and follow along while pushing the programming buttons and practice with it and in a few minutes you will have it figured out.If it had a better design for mounting I would give it five stars.Idea to improved it would be casting high power magnets  into the plastic case and having four through the case holes for screws. The magnets would be nice for sticking it to the side or back of a freezer and still allow you to take it off to read easily.I used wire to hang it on the back of my freezers running the wire through the hinges."
"14","Like several reviewers have stated, the directions are a little foggy to read in the beginning. I bought this so that I would be able to turn a older fridge into a fermentation chamber. I must say that after reading SEVERAL forums and SEVERAL YouTube videos, I was confident enough to give it a shot in my cold garage. I hooked this up to a small space heater inside of my fridge and set it at around 50 degrees with the probe attached to the side of a small container of water. After 24 hours, I checked the temp of the water with another digital thermometer, and I achieved the exact temp that I had set this for. My opinion is that if you attach this to the volume of water(beer) that you have fermenting in your application, you will achieve more accurate temps than just measuring the ambient air of your fermentation chamber. I would not hesitate buying this again!"
"15","I used this gadget to retrofit a small fridge I own that could not seem to be set properly.  Either the fridge would be too cold and freeze things, or it would not be cold enough.  I drilled a 1/4 inch hole in the side wall of the fridge to pass the thermostat sensor inside my fridge.  I set the fridge on the coldest setting, and plugged the power cord into the Johnson Controls unit.  I set the temperature to the desired set-point, and voila, my beer is perfectly cold without being frozen EVER.  Some day when the fridge gives up the ghost, I will salvage the controller and use it on the next fridge.  A great unit that I would recommend without reservation.  Built like a tank too."
"16","Does a great job at managing the temperature on my fermentation chamber.  I hooked this up to a small Danby chest freezer, just large enough to fit each of my fermentation vessels individually.  Setup was fast and fairly straightforward.  A quick look through the manual will acquaint you with the abbreviations in the menu and what you need to adjust to maintain your target temperature within a specified range.  The temperature probe cable is quite long, and there's even mounting instructions if you would like to make it a permanent fixture on whatever you're using it on.  No complaints"
"17","I was looking for something to moderate the temp of my beer fridge, since the little spinning dial / sliding mechanism didn't cut it.  The first thing I saw was temp controls, but they required electrical work and splicing wires.  Pass.Then I saw this, and it works perfectly.  You just plug it into your electrical outlet and then plug the fridge into this, and it turns it off and on based on the probe temp.If I had to complain about something I would say that the probe wire is a bit thick.  I didn't want to drill into my fridge, so this just hangs in the door and the thickness does break the seal on the door slightly.  Also, the probe is not rated to be waterproof, which is problematic when I am trying to maintain the temp of a liquid (beer) not the air temp.  I stick mine in a cup of water anyway, and have had no problems though."
"18","I love when products work as advertised - so refreshing.A little background: I've had my under cabinet Kegerator for a couple years now and over the past 6 months, with the cooling dial set to the LOWEST, it was far too cold for beer (and FROZE solid any other liquid kept in the unit). I resorted to turning the dial OFF, then ON every couple days in a lame attempt to regulate the temperature.Heard about these thermostat controls and figured I'd give them a try. The installation was very simple - I drilled into the left side panel of the Kegerator, fed the sensor cable through and sealed both sides with a caulk-sealant. The thermostat set up was simple as well: set the new thermostat control at 38 degrees and the differential at 4 degrees. Within hours, it was toggling the unit off and on as it hovered between 34 and 42 degrees.Perfect solution!The only reason I rated 4 stars was because the supplier sent the wrong (non-digital) unit. They were very responsive and helpful in sending the correct unit with a return label for the wrong unit."
"19","Excellent product and a helpful seller.  They accidentally sent me the wrong controller.  I responded with an email and they offered to cut the price on the one they sent, or to exchange it.  I went for the exchange and it was very quick with an apology.Ad for the controller, I love it.  I use it to run a keezer in my basement.  It has the ability to set a range if temperatures and a minimum time before it kicks back on so that I can extend the life of my compressor.  Fairly easy to figure out too.  I would definitely recommend it."
"20","I used it to control 2 Ferm Wrap heaters and it worked perfectly. I put the sensor in 1 fermentation bucket (drilled a hole through a solid rubber cork and forced it through for a air tight seat, then drilled an appropriate sized hole in the fermentation bucket for the cork to fit air tight), and used a ""3 way"" on the cord to enable the ability to plug in 2 heaters (one on each fermentation bucket). The monitoring of the temp on one bucket was adequate to keep the temp the same on the second bucket. Don't forget to read the directions and make the initial adjustment to the Thermostat to set it up for warming if you are using it for this. It comes set up to regulate cooling, but it is easy to set it up for warming."
"21","I started homebrewing lagers earlier this year. The first batch was a black lager that had a primary fermentation of 2 weeks, and a lagering period of 4 weeks. To keep it in the proper temperature range, I would have to shuffle it back and forth from my fridge in the basement and a slightly warmer corner nearby. It wasn't difficult, but it was a hassle. I had been eyeing this thermostat for a while and finally ordered it. It comes with an instruction booklet that is very thorough, but is confusing at first. After going over it a couple of times, it made more sense and I programmed it for the next batch. It has been working perfectly and now I don't need to do the carboy shuffle at all and if I am gone for the weekend, I don't have to be worried that it may fall out of the proper temp range. One less variable to be worried about."
"22","This thermostat really works well for converting a chest freezer into an outdoor keg box.  Even on the hottest of days this thermostat keeps your beer at exactly the perfect temperature to ward off the summer heat.  If you're considering putting a kegerator outside, go with a freezer and this thermostat, instead.  There are complaints all over the internet from people who have put keg refrigerators outside, only to find that they can't keep up with the summer heat, leaving them with warm beer on a hot day.  Yum!  A freezer will not have that problem and will, in turn, save you money because it doesn't have to run all the time to keep your beer crispy cool and delicious on a hot day.  The initial setup cost is quite a lot less expensive, too."
"23","My old secondary refrigerator has had a broken thermostat for years.  I've been meaning to have someone come out and fix it, but then I stumbled upon this device.  For the cost of what my local service center wanted just to look at the fridge, this external controller has alleviated the problem.  The user interface really couldn't be easier to use.  It took me about 30 seconds to get the whole setup up and running (granted I ran the sensor probe through the door seal rather than drilling through the side of the unit).  Now I have an extra fridge in my basement for storage overflow and to lager my homebrew.  I would highly recommend this to anyone that has thermostat problems, or requires their refrigerator/freezer unit to be at a very specific temperature."
"24","Wow!  This was a great investment.  I bought this (after reading a ton of reviews) to convert a basement freezer into a drink Fridge.  Thank you to everyone for all of the reviews.  This was extremely easy to set up and it's working exactly as I had expected.  Basically I just had to set the temperature for my needs and then plug it in.When the freezer dips below the assigned temp it turns the power back onto the freezer, and when it rises about the assigned temp it kicks the power back on."
"25","I bought this item in October of 2010 and have used it for controlling fermentation temperature on several batches of beer since then to gain better control and more repeatability in the fermentation character of my beers. It is easy to use and I ferment ales and lagers alike using this controller in conjunction with a chest freezer. It still performs well and is a good no-fuss method for controlling ambient temperature during fermentation of my brew. I understand that some people have had issues where the temperature swings more than they would like. That does happen, but it's more a function of the cooling equipment (in my case my chest freezer) than the controller itself. It can be mitigated by leaving the chest freezer open or plugging in a fan as well as the freezer for circulation around the fermenter. Leaving the freezer lid open with no fan and set to 66F, the freezer will drop to 62F and slowly rise to 66F before kicking in again. The beer has so much thermal mass that I doubt it will actually experience the temperature wave, so in this case I would feel comfortable calling this 64F. If that setpoint is lower, say 47F for a lager, that swing is even tighter with the freezer door open, dropping to maybe 45F at its lowest point. I haven't had to worry about what temperature extremes my beer sees during fermentation since I've had this controller and could do lagers in the hottest months of the year. All in all a very good investment for those brewers that want a little more control over their yeast character in their beers and/or are getting into lager brewing. It seems to be about $10 cheaper now than when I bought it."
"26","I use this controller on a Frigidaire chest freezer to use it as a fermentation chamber as well as a kegerator. It works exactly as I hoped it would. I like the number of options it has to easily customize the exact on/off set points for the freezer when changing what I use the freezer for. I wish the sensor cable was a bit longer, but it can be extended with the correct type of wire. Probably not an issue for most applications. For those who don't already know, make sure you get an analog freezer(the one with the dial to change the temperature) rather than a digital freezer(the type with buttons and an electronic display)."
"27","I installed this last night in my 7.1cu Haier chest freezer and it is doing an amazing job so far. Temperature is staying right at the setpoint. This is by far the easiest way to regulate the temperature in your fridge / freezer. Just plug one end into the wall, the other into your freezer, set the temperature (and anti-short cycle and degrees of variance if desired)Pros:Easy setupAccurate temperatureUpdates very quicklyMenu system makes sense and took a total of 5 minutes to set it upCons:A backlight for the temperature read-out would be nice for dark areasNo option for remote temperature display (have not opened it up yet)Easier mounting options would be a plus (but sticky-back velcro worked for me)"
"28","This is a very well made temp controller. I could not find another one under $150 that would give a 1 degree differential. This thing has every function you could hope for, is made to last, and is at a seriously steal of a price. For beer making, refrigeration, environmental control, if it needs precise control of temp to the degree and you have the proper equipement, this puppy will run it like the best dream you ever had. If I could give it 6 stars I would."
"29","Overall, I'm satisfied with this product.  It works well, has excellent fit and finish, and performs as expected.  There's a little bit of a learning curve, so you'll need to read the instructions that come with it.  Also, the temperature sensor doesn't seem to read what thermometers measure, even when positioned directly next to them.I use it for stabilizing the temperature of fermenting homebrew.  Mostly, it's used to turn on the fridge when the temp creeps up, but sometimes I use it to turn ON a carboy heat wrap in winters when the temp is dropping - this feature is nice and you can't do that with the analog version.Maybe it's expensive, but it's quality and feature-rich."
"30","I recently ordered a Johnson A419ABG-3C Temperature control for my new snake encasement, it did not work & it is virtually impossible to contact the supplier HAVC.  I'm so upset it isn't funny. The instructions are useless for trouble shooting. After half a day on the phone attempting to reach Johsnons for help I finally got sent to a man named Mike, it was clear that he was ""put off"" by my phone call. Well, after pulling on the lines that hook up the sensor it started working. It has only been running for a week & now the sensor isn't reading properly. This was purchased for my grand daughters Boa constrictors, so it's not like I'm brewing beer, I'm trying to keep a living breathing thing alive. I had it set on 90 with a differential of 1 degree & this morning it is staying on 84 & is not shutting off my radiant heat panel. This product cost me almost $100.00 & not being able to find any trouble shooting except for the worthless instructions that come with it is unacceptable for me. I had rated this as a 5 star but am finding myself doing an edit on the rating. If this effects a snake that was just getting over respiratory infection due to abuse at someone else's hands I will be one hot old woman."
"31","I bought this for my kegerator to maintain the ideal temperature for my keg. Easy installation and i love the programming options.  I had to look up a do it yourself video on YouTube to better understand the program settings but i had everything installed and programmed in about 15 minutes. Now my beer is kept at the ideal temperatures of 34 to 36 degrees."
"32","Finished my kegerator build this week, and this was a critical component, because my mini-fridge has settings all the way from freezing to freaking frozen. It now maintains a range from 39 to 41 F perfectly, and was easy to program after a few minutes of quality time with a homebrew and the instructions. I may widen the temperature range a bit to put less wear & tear on the compressor, but that's a tweak anyone with a converted fridge has the option to make. The unit is (I think) nice and compact, too, allowing for a few drill holes and zip ties to hide it and its cord behind the kegerator with no trouble. Highly recommended!"
"33","Easy to configure, does what it should, provides or kills power to electronics based on temperature.Only complaint I'd have is the instruction book is important to keep around as the screen uses codes that you're likely to forget with how infrequently you have to fiddle with this.It retains settings through power outtages which is a big plus!"
"34","Workes perfect to maintain the temperature on any freezer/ fridge. Many people use this to convert a chest freezer to a kegerator, so that the beer doesnt freeze. This is truly a plug and play device. Only a few settings. THe instructions are not really the best, but google it and there are plenty of tutorials. I have used it to ferment beer in a chest freezer, and then later use it to keep it around 40 degrees for my kegs. Its perfect. There are cheaper options, but most require you to wire them to a sensor and power source. So, if you dont want to do that and spend a few more bucks, buy this. Its perfect."
"35","I more recently built a solar water heating box for my pond out of irrigation drip line. I'm using this product to turn the water pump off when the water hits a curtain temperature. the great part is the Johnson Controls Digital Thermostat Control Unit will not turn back on until the temperature drops 5 degrees, so that means once the water hits temperature its not constantly turning on then off, on then off..... one more great thing is that it holds the programmed memory when it get unplugged."
"36","Best Thermostat Control Unit I've bought. Easy to use, all I had to do was to set the temperature that I wanted to be at and set the difference temperature setting. That's all I did and the controller does the rest. The controller controls the compressor going on and off. Also, I set the freezer thermostat controller to where the compressor will activate at my set temperature, from there the Johnson control would get the compressor to come on. Tried other controllers, but this is the best one that is easy and reliable."
"37","The unit arrived on the 4th day after I ordered it (ordered on Sunday evening), that seemed pretty fast. I had read some of the reviews on the product and had a good understanding of the set up procedure. I had it connected to my 4.6cf fermentation frig in about 5 min. I have been observing the temperatures for the past 24 hrs using the Johnson control, and a second electronic thermometer, it is right on!!! The Johnson Control will allow me to have total control of the fermentation temperature of my beer and that is one of the most critical parts of home brewing. If you are a home brewer this is a must in the warmer states like Texas!"
"38","I was skeptical buying this because it wasn't cheap but works awesome!!! i bought an inexpensive dual tap kegerator and without this the temperature was impossible to regulate. It would swing almost 10 degrees. This solves the problem. Turn thermostat on maximum cold and adjust this for precise temperature. It is something like 5 degrees off from my  cheap wireless thermometer I bought but I'm certain its the thermometer thats off and not this unit. Buy it!"
"39","Works Perfectly! at first I was a little confused as to how to set it up to work on a Keezer build, but after reading the manual, It was pretty easy. It comes set up for heating applications, so if you plug it in right out of the box, it wont do anything but click on and off rapidly. You just have to unscrew the plastic casing and move a jumper over so it is connecting the correct pins.once that is done, setting it to the correct temp is really easy. If I ever need to build another Keezer, I will no doubt purchase again."
"40","I bought this product for my chest freezer that I was converting into a kegerator / keezer. It controls the temperature of the freezer, allowing me to keep the temperature at a perfect serving temperature. The included instructions are a bit confusing, but there are plenty of posts our on [...] about ideal settings for this device.Installing and connecting the device could have not been easier... it's pretty much plug-and-play until you start messing with the settings. It's compact without being too small.  The cables on the control unit are long enough for multiple mounting locations."
"41","Im using this for a large (7qt) slow cooker based sous-vide. I've only done steaks so far, but they come out perfectly cooked. I cook for an hour or so after stable temp (125) and then sear on 800(ish) degree cast iron."
"42","I was having trouble with beer freezing in my kegerator in the winter months. Not anymore. The directions are a bit obscure -- I had to go online and watch videos to make sure I had it set up properly. There are plenty of videos and discussions online about the proper use, though.  In the end, I did not have to alter the factory jumper settings to get it to work. Have been using it for a month now without trouble. Maintains the temperature within the specified range."
"43","It works reliably and effectively.  The only reason I don't give it the top rating is that it is based on grossly obsolete technology.  I.e., to reset the device from the default cooling control to heating control, one must open the device with a screwdriver, which the instructions don't tell you, and you must move jumpers among circuit board pins.  This is the way circuit boards were controlled 30 and 40 years ago.  Were I not as old as I am, I would not have known what the instructions were talking about, when referencing pins and jumpers.  In fact, I showed the instructions to some young co-workers, and they were mystified by the instructions."
"44","Great controller. Not sure about how the quality compares to others that are cheaper.This is a high end controller. Can’t go wrong with this one but you may be able to save some money and get something cheaper that might work as well.I have purchased three of these and couldn’t be happier."
"45","This does exactly what you want it to do, so 4 stars for that.I'm not willing to give it five stars because it is not very user friendly.  I had to take it apart to adjust two jumpers to use it with a fermentation heater.  While one jumper was for heating vs. cooling, it wasn't obvious from the instructions how the other needed to be set and so I had to consult Google to be sure.  While I had it open, the insides shifted around slightly, which made putting it back together more challenging than it needed to be.As you can see from the pictures, this is a piece of industrial equipment.  It looks like something that you would find in a factory (which probably explains why it is not user friendly).  If you have it in the basement like me then it is no problem, but if it's in your living space, you might need to hide it."
"46","Works great but setup is not entirely intuitive.  I use is to control the temperature in a keezer I built for my brother.  If this is your intended use make sure the thermometer is at the bottom of the keezer.  Otherwise you may freeze the whole keg."
"47","While sold and advertised as a thermostat control for regulating cooling devices for projects like beer brewing and such, the Johnson Controls Digital Thermostat is also capable of a Heat Mode that regulates temps up to 212 Fahrenheit; this is great news for anyone that is interested in setting up their own water oven for sous vide cooking!In order to do so the unit must be set in Heat Mode (it is set to Cooling Mode by default, indicated by a small snowflake icon on the display when the unit is on), to set the thermostat into Heat Mode you are required to open the unit up with a screwdriver and rearrange 2 small pins from partially connected to fully connected. The instruction manual will show you which pins to adjust. Once the pins have been adjusted just close the unit up and plug it into whatever device you will be using as your water bath (in my case a cleaned out deep fryer), and set your desired Set Point (SP). You will notice that there is a little flame icon on the display where there was once a snowflake, this indicates that the unit is now in Heat Mode. From this point, you can start cooking.Now for my plus minus:+ The unit is capable of regulating higher temps for sous vide cooking.+ The Johnson Controls Digital Thermostat is cheaper than other control units you may find here on Amazon that are sold as ""for sous vide"" (like the Dorkfoods DSV unit in particular).+ Long cords (this can be hit or miss for some but the long cords help in my kitchen).- Not very user friendly, make sure you have the manual handy. While I found the process easy enough, setting the unit to Heat Mode by opening it up and adjusting small delicate pins can be intimidating and confusing for some (I wish this could have been addressed with a simple switch).Overall:While the design does have an annoying flaw, once in Heat Mode you are left with a product that works great and is also cheaper than most other similar devices on the market. A win."
"48","I purchased this to replace a Lux Win100. The temperature sensor was to close to the relay on the Lux and would pick up the relay heat. I was using it  with a 12 amp air conditioner and due to the sensor/relay proximity it would not work for me. The Johnson A419 has an extended temperature sensor and there are no problems when using with the same air conditioner. It is VERY accurate and seems more like an industrial product. I couldn't be happier!!!"
"49","I use this to shut off my Mom's heat tapes on the roof when the temp gets above 35 degrees.  Where the tapes are plugged in is too difficult for my 83 year old Mom to get to."
"50","I bought this to convert a chest freezer into a beverage center for tailgating and outdoor parties (tired of going through tons of ice) and this works great!  Very high quality that I would expect as this is really an industrial unit.  It's fairly easy to mount but doesn't come with any hardware.  The temperature probe is, if anything, too long.  I can't imagine anyone needing it longer."
"51","Works really well with my fermenting chamber. Plug and play. I set it to the max anti-short setting so my freezer doesn't cycle on and off too much. The temperature stays within 2-4 degrees, which is acceptable to me since I would rather have a slight variance than burn the motor out on my freezer."
"52","I have used this device now for almost a year on my Kezzer or converted chest freezer. It was fairly easy to set and to configure. You will need a screw driver and to pay close attention to the instructions ;however, the steps are clear and the use is simple. The temperature probe is durable and the device has worked consistently well for the time t has been in use."
"53","I purchased this controller from Amazon after the temperature controller on my kegerator went bad and stopped turning on the compressor.This unit was extremely easy to set up. It came with a few pages of instructions for adjusting settings. I spent maybe 10 minutes total.I have the controller mounted on the back of my kegerator with double-sided foam tape and in the position the cables were more than long enough.For the price, you're not going to find a better plug-n-play controller (I've looked)."
"54","I purchased this to convert a small chest freezer into a refrigerator.  Very simple to do I just mounted the controller on the wall behind the freezer. Plugged the freezer into the thermostat, plugged the thermostat into the wall socket. Place the temperature probe into the freezer, set the thermostat at 38F and it will prevent the freezer from running long enough to freeze. Simply put this thermostat overrides the freezers thermostat."
"55","I bought a chest freezer and I control the temperature with the Johnson Digital Controller. In the Arizona desert, having a place with a constant temperature to place fermenters is  difficult. This product works great for my needs, it is easy to install and to adjust to the temperature I need the freezer to be at for fermenting various beers or using various varieties or yeast."
"56","As a man, though, it was somewhat of an affront to my masculinity as I was required to actually read the manual to discern what the menu display was telling me. Once I figured it out, it's super easy to make small changes to the temperature when needed. I found that I had to do a little trial and error to get to the temperature I needed for my little modified fermentation fridge. For example, I needed to set the thermostat to 70 degrees in order for temperature to hover around 68. Setting it to 70 meant that the second the probe sensed 70 degrees, the fridge would kick on and the probe would register down to about 66 before the fridge shut off. My fridge is a 1 cubic foot dorm fridge that I converted to a fermentation fridge by removing the door and taping a box made out of 1"" styrofoam insulation the size of my carboy to the front of it. Works amazingly well!!! Obviously, your mileage may vary with your fridge. Happy Brewing!!!"
"57","I live in the desert of Las Vegas, and my biggest problem when brewing is getting proper temperatures for my brews. In the summer, we lower our A/C when we leave the house, so the house heats up along with my wort. The constant change in temperatures has given me off flavors in my ales. And you could forget about lagering.That's where this little beauty came in handy. I bought a used stand-up freezer and can control the temperature of my brews with it. I put my fermenter in the freezer, set it for the proper temperature range of my yeast, and that it's! It's so easy. I am now lagering in the desert, and I never could have without this item.Most homebrewers face issues with temperature, but if you have an extra fridge or freezer (which I'd reccommend over a fridge), this is just the thing.As a bonus, if you have a freezer converted into a keezer, this little device will allow you to maintain proper temperatures. It's also very energy efficient. I give this little bad boy a big thumbs up!"
"58","I used this control to turn a chest freezer into a fridge for my home brew corney kegs and it has worked perfectly for over a month now.  I found it to be fairly straightforward on setup.  Just plug the unit into the wall, the freezer into the unit and run the temperature sensor through the freezer top (no need to drill).  It did take a minute or two to review the manual to find out what the abreviations stand for (that flash up on the display) when inputing temperature and freezer run duration etc.  Beyond that is it a simple product that does exactly what I wanted it to do.  It has kept the temperature right where I want it and kept me from having to wire in a new control unit which I wasn't comfortable doing."
"59","Bought this controller to regulate the temperature in my Keezer.  Took some getting used to in programming the controller.  Depending on how far the probe is in the keezer determines what the temp displays.  I had to play with this some.  Ended up freezing some water in the bottom and freezing the CO2 gauge when the probe was too high up.  Other than that it works well for the application that I need."
"60","If you are reading this, you are most likely a beer drinker looking to convert a chest freezer into a keg freezer (keezer) draft beer dispenser.  Well, I'm here to tell you that everything you read out there on the interweb that led you to this item is true.  Once you get it set up properly, you will always have a well chilled beer at hand.  And for anyone else who might happen to be looking to use this item for what it was intended for... I can tell you that it keeps my keezer at the temperature that I want it to be.  mmmmmmmmm beer....."
"61","I have had and have been using this unit for about two months as a temperature controller for a 14.8 cu ft chest freezer turned into a cooler for Cornelius kegs filled with luscious beer.  So far, it works well as described, even if the interface is a bit confusing.  Keep a copy of the instruction's interface page near the unit in order to prevent mistakes in programing.If you need a temperature controller in this product's description, get this."
"62","this is my second one of these. so much more accurate than the analog dial type. the setting are easy and clear. the range is broad. i use mine with an upright freezer for fridge to freeze temp ranges. great value for the features and quality.Nov 15th updatei bought a 2nd one for a chest freezer. works great but since chest freezers have no fans it is not able to hit target temps as accurately. the range is fantastic though. still ove this."
"63","So I waited months before writing a review on this little unit. It's being used to convert a bench freezer into Kegerator. It works great and was already in the correct mode when I received it. All I had to do was set the temp and run the sensor into the freezer. The construction is great, mounting was easy, and it has not given me any issues at all. If anyone is trying to convert a freezer into a fridge or kegerator this is a must have."
"64","Super simple to use, but understanding the abbreviations is unintuitive because the display can only show two characters. There are a lot more settings than I needed. For the record, SP stands for Set Point and is the temperature you want. The device displys the current temperature."
"65","If you are looking for a control unit for your freezer to make it a kegerator this is perfect. Some of the analog units are cheaper but I prefer the digital display/control and for a few extra bucks it is worth the piece of mind.  Johnson was even nice enough to have it programmed for kegerator duty out of the box, I just reviewed the settings and pressed on with the install."
"66","I use this to convert an upright freezer to a refrigerator. The freezer came with the house we bought, and we didn't have a need for a 6' freezer, but did have a use for a second fridge. It's currently doing duty as a beer fridge keeping everything at a nice 40 degrees F."
"67","Does what it's supposed to, controls a heater or cooler in response to temperature. If you take the time to read the manual, it is easy to set the jumpers to select heating/cooling. The front panel allows setting the activation setpoint and differential even on-the-fly, this too is easy. I used it to control a heater in a hotbox, absolutely reliable. I could have purchased the A419 control and wired it in myself, saving a measley $19, but why? This has the socket and plug already wired in, perfect for my application."
"68","I made a fermenting chamber out of a Danby 7.0 Cu ft chest freezer. So far this is working great.  I live in FL and the temps always go wacky so I need something consistent for brewing purposes.  This has been holding ambient ten at about 68 degrees.  perfect for ales.  I can't wait to drop it down a notch for lagers. Cheers!"
"69","Im a snowbird and i use this controll to operate a battery heater between two paving blocks in a small freezer to create a no freeze zone to store freeze sensitive foods while im gone for the winter.when i return i revert freezer to its original purpose.pavers act as thermal storage in case of power failures."
"70","The two things preventing me from giving this product 5 stars are the following:-I've only owned it for a few days so I'm not sure how well it will hold up, though I have no reason to believe it won't last for a long time.-The instructions could have been a bit clearer; I didn't understand the difference between the ""cut in"" and ""cut out"" settings.After doing some research I was able to find a few threads on home brew forums that clearly described the differences between the cut in and cut out settings.In cooling mode, with ""cut in"" selected, the unit will supply power starting at the set point and will cut off after it senses the temperature has hit the set point minus the differential. So if you set your temp to 40F and you have a differential of 4F, the unit will supply power starting at 40F and then stop supplying power at 36F.In ""cut out "" mode, the unit would supply power starting at 44F and then stop supplying power at 40F.As I am neither a controls expert nor HVAC professional, It took me a while to come to this understanding.The details of how to change all the settings are very clearly explained in the instructions ([...] what all the settings mean aren't.Overall, it seems to be a great product, and many people have used it to great success. It is keeping my keg-orator at a nice temperature right now and I don't have to worry about it freezing up due to a poorly set thermostat."
"71","A few of us purchased this and set it up so that it controls a space heater inside an insulated box we built that houses several glass carboys. We taped the temp probe to the side of one of the carboys and then insulated over that probe so that it's reading the temp of the fermenting beer rather than the air temp. We made ourselves a nice little fermentation space in a cold garage so we don't aggravate the wives or have to transport carboys to our various houses from where we do our brewing. We have an analog Johnson controller hooked up to a keezer but it doesn't seem to be working. I may purchase anther one of these to hook up to the keezer to keep our kegs chilled and possibly do some lagering."
"72","It took a little while to understand exactly how to operate the thing, but I made it more complicated than it needed to be. Read the directions and check out some home brewing forums for tips and even clearer explanations. It keeps my fridge/""fermentation chamber"" exactly where I want it. Fermentation temperature is super critical. This makes brewing life that much easier!"
"73","works great. i got two of them one for a dorm fridge for the workshop and one for the wood stove. i set the one for the wood stove to bring on the whole house fan when the temp in the room where the wood stove is gets above 72 degrees. it keeps from moving cold air around at night when the fire goes out. the fridge does not have a working thermostat in it.... now it has one better than it had new when it was new.  you can control anything you want to with a narrow or wide temp swing as you want.  heat of cool. simply plug one end into a 110v receptacle and the other end into your controlled device."
"74","Five years later, it's still going strong in the Keezer.  No complaints.  Wiring it up took a little bit of doing, but it wasn't that complicated."
"75","Simply the best bang for the buck and easiest to use temp controller you can get.  Have one on a large 8 tap ""keezer"" and my beer fridge which doubles as a lager/fermentation chamber.  Both running strong for nearly 3 years and hasn't cost me a blown motor yet (knock on wood)."
"76","I use this on a 20 cubic foot stand-alone freezer to age beer.  It's simple to use and keeps the interior of the fridge no colder than 52 degrees.  I couldn't be happier w/ this purchase.  I trust it to protect $2500 worth of amazing craft brews!"
"77","I was looking for something that would help me take a chest freezer and control the temperature to refrigeration levels without any fuss.  This device was perfect for my keggerator chest freezer conversion.  If you're looking to store food in here and are worried about losing power or the device failing (like one reviewer commented on) then get some sort of supplemental alarm/thermostat that will sound if the temperature goes above X°.It took a little figuring out at first as the instructions were pretty cryptic from a non-scientific/electronics expert perspective.  From a conversion standpoint, simply hit the menu button until you see SP flashing, hit the menu button one more time to set the temperature, and then set to your target temperature.There are other variables you can set for the differential, but all in all it does a great job and gets it done!"
"78","If you have one of those Danby Kegorator units with a faulty thermostat... direct wire your compressor to a grounded extension cord and plug it into this baby.  It will keep your beer an even cool and even save wear on the compressor from the schizo thermostat changes."
"79","I used it to turn an upright freezer into a refrigerator that now can store lots of cold beer and drinks at the perfect temperature (just above freezing). The Instructions were a little ""techy"" with all the possible settings but after a few cycles, I was able to figure out what temp to set it so it would cutout at the right temp and maintain my cold beer/cold drinks.I looks like it is going to save more energy because of the efficiency of the freezer combined with the TCU. The freezer is not running all the time and the TCU kicks it on only when the temp reaches above the set point.Now I have a great drink cooler for the garage."
"80","Works great. I chose this based on reviews. I have attached it it the side of my freezer simply with two sided tape. The directions are slightly technical and can be confusing so you will need to put your thinking cap on for a minute or two, but this device was not made specifically for home brewers. Work with the differential to keep the freezer from turning on all the time."
"81","quality temp control on my chest freezer-cum-fermentation chamber. seems to get a bit below the set temp. popped the probe in some cooler pack gel in a little tub to get a more stable temp read."
"82","Fantastic for temperature control on your freezer so you can brew beer at controlled temperatures.  I stick the thermometer up against the carboy and insulate with Styrofoam and haven't noticed any significant temperature differences from when i take readings.  Works great."
"83","Simple, simple, simple. Works exactly like it should in my keezer. I mounted it behind the collar, read the simple instructions for setting the temp, span, and what to do if it fails (either run device or shut off device), put the probe in water in the keezer, and turned it on. No problems at all."
"84","I bought a refrigerator and wanted to make it into a wine cooler.  The Johnson Controls Digital thermostat does the job well.  Plug the control into the electrical outlet and then plug the fridge into it.  I set the temp for 60 degrees and it cycles on and off to keep the cooler between 55 and 60.  Exactly what I wanted.  It is quite easy to use.  I programmed it before I read the directions.  Very intuitive."
"85","Like many others, I bought this item to create a cheese aging cage out of my small refrigerator and I agree with the fact that no matter how low the actual settings are, there is no way the inner temperature can get to the 54-58 F range which is what most aging cheeses ask for. You can buy a wine fridge, which I did ( a small one, but I overgrew it already), but the price tag for a decent size (say 3-4 cubic feet) starts with $200 so that is something I don't want to invest on. So, based on the good reviews I bought this item after using it for 2 weeks now here are the pros and cons that come to my mindPros:1-Well built quality and decent cord length (both the sensor and the powerline) so that you can hide the item at the back and still turn around the sensor and put it inside (better put it somewhere it stays without moving, I put my sensor into an empty salt dispenser and taped the dispenser's opening so that it does not get out easily. Then I put the dispenser on the fridge door (works fine for the moment)2- Accuracy in the temperature readings: I checked the temperature that shows on the thermostat and the temperature inside (using two different room thermometers) and see the difference with in 1F or less and that is due to the other settings I adjusted like the cut in and cut off temperature difference or so (if your target temperature is 54F this item gives you the option of the acceptable range. So you set, lets say, 2F difference in menu and whenever it is 56F then it lets the cooling and whenever the temperature hits 52 F it stops the current. (you have the option of setting this difference as low as 1F)3-Many additional features: One of them is the difference function that I explained above and the other one is the function to prevent fast compressor cycling. Most refrigerators use a compressor to function. It is not recommended to switch on and off the compressor in very short intervals (say less than a minute or so) or the compressor life expectancy fails. So this device lets you set the minimum compressor cycling time. This means that even if the temperature goes up or down the set temperature if the compressor has recently started working or shut down, it waits until the set time to pass before turning the compressor on/off again. I set mine to 2 minutes.Cons:Not many so far but if I must write a few words, I can say that the manual is ridiculously complex. You only need 1/3 of the information written on it. The descriptions target an electrician who wants to tear it into pieces and make it again from scratch. But that is nothing I can complain as long as I can dissect out the information I need to find.In terms of price: It is not ridiculously expensive but it is not cheap either. I would like it to be $10 cheaper but a $70-80 range can be considered as a fair price range.So for a home cheese maker, I recommend this product. But one thing to remind: Temperature is not the only thing that matters in cheese aging. A relative humidity of over 75% is what most cheese desire and this item does not help in that. So far, I am trying to kill the dryness inside the fridge by adding damp clothes, napkins or water jars but seems I need to work on it some more.."
"86","This is the third one I've used and what I'll continue to use.  I have this controlling a few chest freezers that I've converted for beer lagering/keg storage purposes.Dead simple operation."
"87","This is agreat product. I only give it 4 stars cause I feel like it's more expensive than it really needs to be. I also feel that it could be a little bit more intuitive. The instructions are somewhat straightforward but it takes a little bit to get everything configured all the way."
"88","I hooked this up to a chest freezer in my garage to store my buckets and carboys of beer for fermenting. Works great! Controls the temperature perfectly, kicks on the chest freezer when needed. Great buy for homebrewers!"
"89","As the weather changed from cool to warm in the few months since I got this, I have had a chance to use this with a FermWrap on a 6.5 Gallon Carboy, and then on a mini-fridge. The pin swap is pretty easy after the first time, and took about 5 minutes to reconfigure for the fridge. JC is used to industrial applications, and this shows in the quality of this unit."
"90","good product, using for a ""keezer"" chest freezer converted to kegerator. Works well but must carefully place probe for temperature. Also have to adjust short cycle and deadband to liking. a little pricey but I'm getting another one for an old wine fridge a friend gave me, which has a bad thermostat... plan to use as a patio fridge/lager fridge."
"91","Saved my pool fridge which lost it's mind after 2 years and was either too hot or deep freeze. I installed this in have it overriding the compressor. Literally the temp is a perfect 33-34 degrees and it's very constant. I had one of these back in the day for brewing beer in a hot climate. I took an old freezer and set this controller to 68 degrees to ferment beer. It worked like a champ."
"92","I purchased this to use for sous vide, beer brewing, and occasional wine fridge use. It is pretty easy to set up, and very well-built.  Probably more cord on it than most people need (I shortened mine), but better to have excess than not enough."
"93","Does what you expect, pretty much as you'd expect. I used it to convert a chest freezer into a fridge. Add a sheet of pink board or two and you can have a combo fridge and sub-zero for a pittance compared to regular standing fridges."
"94","Got this for a Xmas gift, plugged in and set unit to 35 degrees. Check it the following morning and it was reading 55 degrees. Checked jumpers and were set to cool. Checked it with a meter and the plug that's used for the refrigerator was not getting any power. Returning for another unit (hoping it works) and will change my ranking if it works. Understand that things happen, but kind of left a bad taste in my mouth with it not working...crossing my fingers for a unit that works!"
"95","I have a 4 tap beer box made from a chest type freezer and I purchased this digital thermostat controller to set the temperature inside the box. It was easy to install although the directions for setting the temperatures are very confusing. Once set, it works just fine."
"96","I use the thermostat to control the temperature in a chest freezer that I use for fermenting beer (35-55 F).  The controller works great for this purpose.  I also have a second one that I plan on using to operate a HERMS device for my mashing system.  You can set the controller to operate a heater or cooling device but you must reposition ""jumpers"" inside the unit (not difficult but a pain if you plan on doing it often).  If you want a unit that switches automatically betweem cooling and heating, you are better off with the more expensive Ranco controller.This particular controller will allow you to set the target temperature (as either a closing or openning point), the number of degrees of variance from target before the unit turns on/off, a time delay before the unit is allowed to reactivate the device(great for extending the life of a freezer or fridge), power supply on/off option in the case of unit failure and options for using remote monitoring/controlling if you choose to upgrade.For the money, it is the best value on the market.  No wiring required, simply plug in the device to the controller and the controller into the wall.  The Ranco offers more options if you prefer to wire your own device or you can go all out and use a Love or other commercial controller that is fully customizable but is best mounted into a control device panel.  Check out [...] for examples of what can be done with more sophisticated controller units."
"97","This little baby is the temperature controller to my keg freezer.  I have it locked in at 38 deg.  It controls the power supply to the freezer that is now my kegerator.  If you want a programable temperature controller, this is for you."
"98","So I bought this to use on a fridge for fermenting beer . It does the job . Plug it in the wall and plug the fridge into the controller and set the controller to come on at a ? temp and shut off at ? temp . Has a lot of setting that I know nothing about but the cut in cut out and dif  settings do just as they are supposed to ."
"99","This was a Christmas Gift for my Hubby - who is in fourth year of Brewing his on Beer.  He was very HAPPY with this gift now he can brew in the heat of the Summer!!  How refreshing will that be??  Great delivery time and the Unit seems in Great shape. All in all it was a very smooth transaction - I would not expect anything less from Amazon!! Thank you again Amazing Amazon!!"
"100","Couldn't ask for a more reliable temperature control for my fermentation chamber.  Spot on accurate and works as you would expect."
"101","I've purchased two of these.  The first I use to control a heater belt around a beer fermenter.  It's proven reliable for the 2-3 years I've used it.  Recently, I bought a second unit to control the temperature of a freezer I converted into a kegerator.I like the flexibility of operation.  It appears to be reliable. I highly recommend."
"102","Bought this for my keezer that sits in my kitchen. I keep it around 40-43 degrees normally for ales. It has worked great for me for over a year. If you read the directions, you can understand the on screen abbreviations and get this set up very quickly."
"103","Great for any device... refrigerator... chest freezer... etc. that you want to control the temp. Product worked great and has  been since I installed it a year or so ago. Called Johnson Controls for some help and the guy was great and assisted me with some configuration. Price was good on Amazon too. Local brew shops wanted over $100 for this guy and I think I got it for $68."
"104","Bought this item to use with a freezer that I am turning into a Keezer. Works great, but the temperature varies slightly compared to the other thermometer I have in the cooler."
"105","I bought this for use in a home made sous vide oven. It works great and I could not be more pleased."
"106","Using this to regulate a chest freezer for home brew kegs. Easy to adjust and setup. I set it at 44 degrees and with my small freezer, the unit kicks in the freezer, lowering it to 39 degrees. I'm sure this 5 degree swing is normal and dependent in freezer type.Great unit."
"107","If you need one of these, this is the one to get. Works perfectly with my kegerator, I simply hardwired the compressor and condenser fan to the power input and this device now functions as my controller. All for a fraction of the price of ordering OEM replacement parts."
"108","Very good. I needed to use another thermometer to get accurate temperature setting. Suggest using thermometer that measures liquid temperature since most of the food in the refrigerator is of a liquid nature."
"109","I have been using the johnsons controls thermostats for years with great success. I use them for my reptile enclosures to run flex watt heat tape. They are simple to set up and I have yet to have one fail."
"110","We've been using this control unit to turn an average chest freezer ($200 while on sale) into a kim-chee freezer (costs at least $800 for the same size). By setting the unit at 0~1`C, we've been getting some pretty good kim-chee, not to mention long lasting and tasty fruits and vegetables. The set up is very easy. Just, make sure to set up the unit so that it does not power off and then on is less than 5 minute intervals."
"111","Nice controller.  Plug the controller into the outlet, and the chiller or heater into the controller.  Insert the temp probe into the thermo well, and choose your set point.  Johnson Controls make high quality products.  Very happy with it."
"112","I bought this to regulate the temperature inside of a refrigerator used to store beer while it is fermenting.  It was extremely easy to set up (if you can set an alarm clock or a DVR to record, then you can program this controller), and it works great.  My unit came already wired, all I had to do was plug the refrigerator into the controller, plug the controller into the wall socket, and set the temperature and other parameters.  It took me about 5 to 7 minutes.  I checked the temperature of the sensor against two other thermometers (a probe-type for cooking, and a regular outdoor-type thermometer) and it is spot on.  Great product, fast shipping (item arrived just three days after I ordered)."
"113","Woow this was the best. We Instaled it and it work very well."
"114","Great temperature controller. I use it for both a beer fermentation chamber and kegerator. I only use the setpoint and differential features, and they work flawlessly. I tape directly to the side of my bucket for fermentation and immerse in a cup of water for kegerator (keep water level below probe crimp and put electrical tape around crimp for extra protection). Results in great tasting beer. Money well spent."
"115","I'm using this to control a danby kegerator. At first the wiring was a little tricky but found instructions on the internet to bypass the kegerator's temp control and use this instead. Now the beer has very little foam and is super nice and cold!! I should have bought and installed this thing years ago!!!"
"116","I am using this on a chest freezer converted into a keezer for beer. It works awesome and I have had no issues with it. Setting it is easy, and it also offers degree tolerances for temperature settings (+/- 1, 2 or 3 degrees). This capability works great for step temperature adjustments when lagering."
"117","I dislike that that the probe wasn't fully waterproof. That's sort of the point isn't it? It did control temperature OK."
"118","Works great! I used this to resurrect a mini fridge that lost the ability to turn itself off. Just a quick hole in the side to insert the probe, and you're good to go. Will be using it again shortly to turn a chest freezer into a temperature-controlled fermenting box for home brew."
"119","I use this controller to cycle a small fridge for maintaining beer fermenting temps (68 degF) here in the South. It comes setup for that purpose without the need to move jumpers or change programming though that's an option and is easily accomplished. Reference materials are clear and concise. Best of all it works!"
"120","Most people are buying this temp. controller for home brewing to convert a freezer into a fridge. My application was to use it as an aquarium heater controller. When using this item for my purpose it was not plug and play but was easily converted in less than 10 minutes. The controller works flawlessly and I am very happy with it."
"121","I bought this to keep a constant temp on my chest freezer for fermenting beer, Works great keeps it within ~2 degrees of where I set it.the device works by plugging the standard male wall plug from your freezer into a female one that comes attached to the device"
"122","Switching this unit from cooling to heating mode for use in sous vide could not be simpler (I'm using a crockpot as my heat source.)  Just move jumper pin 1 inside the control unit from disconnected to connected and you're ready to cook! Works exactly as expected. The power cable from the outlet to the unit is a little long for my uses, but it's only a minor inconvenience.I only took away one star for not including a waterproof temperature sensor. Sure I could put it in a plastic bag, but I'd rather not."
"123","I would have given this a 5 star rating however the instructions are a bit detailed.  The product works flawlessly and has not let me down yet.  Once you figure it out, it is super easy which is why you wonder how the instructions couldn't have been a bit easier to follow. It allows precise temperature control and is heavy duty."
"124","Perfect for lagering homebrew or keeping beer at desired temperature for serving.  Easy.  Plug and play, just 4 sub menus for total fridge control.  Highly recommended.  I'm in my 3rd year of brewing, wish I had gotten one sooner.  Lagering is not hard, so step it up! My Baltic porter is very happy with Bohemian lager yeast (wyeast) at 53 F.  Just make a large starter (15 minute extract boil of 1.040 gravity). Ferment one day in advance."
"125","IF you getting serious  about Homebrewing and  you want to make award winning  beer ..... then temperature control is  Everything when it comes to  Fermenting  Beer.....Johnson Controls Digital Thermostat is The Best..... Easy to Use.....  This  will keepYour kegerator/Fermentation Chamber at a  constant temp......"
"126","I got this along with a heater for my wine fermentation and it works amazingly well.  It keeps my fermentation a lot more consistent and has taken a lot of worry away from the process."
"127","I use this on my kegerator and it is a lot easier to set a precise temp over the analog dial controller"
"128","working great - using it for the freezer specially maintained for around freezing temp.had some issue at the beginning - found the default setting was heater mode.Once fixed, working very fine. :)"
"129","I absolutely love this! I bought this to control the temperature of my refrigerator while for my home brew beer. Very easy to use and works great! All I had to do was drill a hole in an old refrigerator for the temperature probe and seal it with some foam. This is a must have for any home brewers!"
"130","I have this unit on a 1938 GE. Fridge that is used for my Beer only.It keeps is at exactly 32 Degrees all the time.I had it in use for about 2 Years now with no problems what so ever."
"131","I used the control unit to create a cooling system for an enclosed cabinet.  The instructions are a little complicated so know that it ships on cooling and to get it to heating mode you will need to flip the jumper.  Very easy to set up and the least expensive way I was able to control a high draw fan."
"132","Bought this for my beer brewing.  Haven't gotten my chest freezer or extra fridge yet to try out the temp regulating, so right now it's just an expensive digital thermometer but it works great!  Had it hooked up into the brew pot and was able to control the temp of my boil the entire time.  Will update the review once I try it out with my chest freezer."
"133","This product has been amazing for helping to maintain a constant temperature in a homemade jacketed fermenter that I made for lagering or just keeping an eye on the temperature during the warm summer months."
"134","This product works great. We bought it to help control the temperature inside of our beer meister to help prevent frozen kegs. It was easy to install and easy to setup the settings. The best part is it keeps the beer ice cold."
"135","I use this JC D-Therm to control my kegorator.  It is an indispensable upgrade over the cheap-Charlie, useless piece of #$!@ that came stock on the refrigerator.  I would recommend this controller for any refrigeration control task.  Easy aftermarket install."
"136","I needed a device to keep room temp around 80 degrees F. This runs my electric heaters without having the room too hot or cold. If the electric turns off and on it does not change settings! Very nice."
"137","Works perfectly.  Has a number of options for dialing in on exactly the right temperature.  I use this to control fermentation temperatures for beer.  I just fold up a towel and secure it to the bucket or carboy with a big rubber band, and tuck the temperature probe between the fermenter and towel."
"138","This product works perfect for controlling the temperature in my beer cellar."
"139","Especially, KOREAN Kochi refrigerator, all you need this temp control and economic  freezer to set up year round temperature 33 F."
"140","I haven't heard any complaints from my Husband, so it must work as expected. He has his first batch of beer in the freezer using this thermostat so we will find out soon how happy he is with it. I priced this item at a few different places and this was the best price I could find."
"141","Very easy to install, and so far it works perfectly. I use it for a Kegerator to keep the temp between 35-39 degrees and this works like a charm. As long as it keep on working i will recommend this product all day."
"142","Nice reliable product.  I currently use it on an old wine fridge as a homebrew fermentation chamber.  It had a bad thermostat and I already had this controller.  Holds the perfect temp, especially brewing in the summer."
"143","Wow so far so good. This thing is accurate to ~1 degree or so. You can set the difference of the set point you to when the heater comes on to whatever interval you want. I am using this for an aquarium with a finnex th heater."
"144","I was having wide temperature swings with my kegerator, making it impossible to control foam. This maintains the perfect temperature. Plug the kegerator into this control unit and turn the kegerator's temperature control to the coldest setting."
"145","Very easy to use once you understand the different codes. Just plugged in my refrigerator and attached the thermostat to the carboy with tape and insulation. Set the temperature along with the offset and it worked perfectly. Very easy to change temperature, if necessary."
"146","I use this when lower fermentation temps are required for my home brew.Just drill a hold in the back of a fridge or freezer, insert probe, piggyback electrical chord to the thermostat and you are ready to go.simple and effective."
"147","Its been running for over a month so,  so far so good.  It holds its temp but has to be set lower than the desired temp.  a thermometer in the freezer is a must for accurate settings"
"148","Keeps my kegerator beer cooler..."
"149","I am satisfied with good products"
"150","converted a 13cu ft freezer into a cornie keg cooler and couldn't be happier. been chillin up to five pinners of homebrews with room to spare for a co2 tank, hops, yeast and bottles - makes lagering a piece of cake. very consistent and easy to use."
"151","You can do so many different things with this. I love it"
"152","The Johnsons Digital Control Unit did exactly what it I bought it for!It controls the temperature on my fermenting sausage refrigerator within 4 degrees.Very easy to operate and solidly built..I recommend!"
"153","Works great! The unit worked flawlessly and the instructions were clear. The options were numerous - heating, cooling, set points, failure modes - LOVE IT! We have already successfully used it a couple of time for curing resins. Be sure to buy some thermally conductive compound to use between the probe and the surface you're measuring."
"154","money saver for malfunctioning fridges or re-purposing freezers for fridges or kegerators!  also use them to control cheap electrical heaters that have no thermostat."
"155","Has worked well for me for the last 3 years.  Can't complain"
"156","I've had this thing working on my kegerator for years now and I've never had any problems with it.  It's solid and works exactly as advertised.  I do wish it was a bit cheaper, but the quality is certainly there."
"157","This temp controller works well and is fairly simple to use. I'm using it to control fermentation temp on a minifridge and it's doing a great job. Digital readout is accurate (compared to thermometers inside the fridge) and easy to use after a quick read of the instruction manual. My beers have been turning out better. Includes an adjustable cycle timeout for older fridges and an adjustable +/- variation limit.Great addition to a homebrewers' arsenal."
"158","After a failed attempt at getting it to control my little brewing ""freezer"",  I decided to read the directions!  Aha!  There's instructions as to how to set the pins inside the thermostat so that it cools down to 34F, but stops there and not get any colder.  Works like a charm."
"159","I bought this to keep tighter control on my keezer (Google it if you don't know).  The directions seem to be written for an HVAC professional (and/or I'm just dense, which is entirely possible), but it's keeping my beer nice and frosty cold."
"160","great product"
"161","Hope it works well, the instructions are far more involved than they should be for a thermostat.I need this thing but it is a pain in the butt to set up."
"162","my kegerator was fluctuating in temp, so i put its thermostat on max setup this digital  thermostat now the temp is so stable.very happy with it!"
"163","The control is easy to install and operate.  I now have a great cheese cave for my homemade cheeses.  Keep in mind it will also affect the freezer portion of your refrigerator unit."
"164","This is a product that does just what it says with a fair amount of ease of operation.Read the directions, I had a friend in electronics help which just made the programing go faster but you can do it if your not an electrition."
"165","I bought this for a chest freezer that I turned into a kegerator. It's plug and play. I used a 5 gal bucket of water to check for liquid temps. The liquid temps are lower than the air temps. This thermostat reads air temps."
"166","we bought this product to control the temp. in our 37 cubic foot smoker (a sub zero freezer with the parts removed). we followed the instructions and in 5 minutes we were good to go.  It was plugged in to a 1500 watt heat element and cycled very smoothly all day and held the temp within the set variance. If you need one that will hold more amps you will have to step up to the hard wire version.  we are ordering another one for a second heating element.  great product and very portable"
"167","Seems to be of good quality. Someday I hope to figure out how to operate it."
"168","This thing rocks. Easy to use and configure.  Keeps my beer right at 33 degrees"
"169","It is easy to set up and use as stated....the cool thing is once its dialed in you can unplug it, and that fridge goes back to normal ,and with out any more adjustments you can plug it in to another and it works great as is. I use it for fermenting, and love it."
"170","Been using these with my reptiles for many years, never had one break or malfunction."
"171","When we upgraded our freezer I used this temp control to convert it to a fermentation chamber. Then when I want to cold crash the beer or wine I just lower the temp for a couple of days.  Need to get a second one and build my kegerator."
"172","First unit I received died within a week; it stopped sending power to the freezer. Thanks to the excellent customer service from The Beverage Factory, I was sent another unit free of charge. This unit has been working ever since without issue. I find this item very user friendly for making a home fermentation chamber out of an old freezer. It also seems durable, despite my problems with the first one."
"173","the cheapest reliable temperature controller i'd seen on amazon when i bought it. it can be a little inaccurate at times by 1-3 degrees, but for the most part works well."
"174","I'm using this controller to set the temperatures in a fridge I use as a fermentation chamber for brewing. Works great! You can set it to a target temperature and adjust how much of a range is allowed above and below your target."
"175","I used mine to turn a chest freezer into a refrigerator. When you open a standard refrigerator the cold air literally falls to the floor and thus the refrigerator cycles much more often.  When you open a box or chest freezer (which is usually better insulated) most of the cold air stays in the bottom of the box when you open it instead of it escaping from the bottom, like your fridge. Many people use this conversion as an energy saving device and all it takes is pluging it in and setting the temp to somewhere above freezing. I've heard it said you can save 70-90% of energy consumption using this configuration, so if you are off the grid, it might really pay off for you. However, it is more difficult to arrange and stack your cold items for rotation and easy access. Hope this helps."
"176","Two year's worth of service without a hiccup, and still going strong!  Easy to set up.  I use mine to control the temp in my kegerator which I built from a chest freezer.  I've also used it to maintain lagering temp.  Go for the digital model - you won't be sorry."
"177","have 2 of these on line, one for a kegurator, the other i use to control fermentation for home brewing beers.easy to set up and adjust temp as needed.  hot or cold control."
"178","Worked beyond my expectations. It actually stays exactly at the right temp. I am using it to ferment beer. It is in my mini fridge. I am using it with a Mr. Beer kit. We left the house for ten days ant it got to the 90's in the house while we were gone. The mini fridge stayed at 72 degrees the entire time. I will see what the beer tastes like in a week. That will be the real test."
"179","I love this product. Bought a $300 freezer and turned it into a wine fridge. Easy to install and operate. Calling them for tech support is practically impossible."
"180","Works great on my upright freezer that I use to cellar beer."
"181","Great brand new control unit, and easy installation.  It is the perfect solution for the homebrewer for lagering or consistent low-temperature carbonation without the risk of freezing.  Just a suggestion - the factory default setting is +/- 7 degrees F.  Change this to +/- 2 or so for a more stable environment."
"182","used it to hack a sous-vide cooker out of a crockpot. Works great!"
"183","We use this to regulate a bread proofing box""s temperature.  It works great.  We live in Oregon on the coast where it is colder and really need it.  My wife makes artisan breads and feels much more secure using this controller in the proofing box."
"184","Used this product to keep a chest freezer right around 29 degrees and created a keezer (freezer kegerator) out of it, does the job well and can limit cycles to keep the freezer running for a long time."
"185","Works exactly as it is supposed to. just like some others have said directions can be confusing. there is a review by claws dat scratch that is very helpful with understanding the setup. if you need some help with setup check out their review.http://www.amazon.com/review/RCZQX32L8IW6U/ref=cm_cr_dp_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00368D6JA&nodeID=228013&store=hi#wasThisHelpful"
"186","Use it in sous vide cooking and works like a charm.  Connected it to a hot plate with a huge pot of water with a vegetable steamer to hold the food above the heating element surface.  What resulted was mind blowing for me; was able to do perfectly cooked hard boiled eggs, poached eggs in-shell, exactly cooked steaks (pan seared afterwards obviously), and the best chicken I have ever tasted in my life.  Can also be used in a kegerator, but a perfectly chilled beer does not bring quite the eureka moment that a perfectly cooked piece of chicken does.Total cost of my entire sous vide rig was only 90 dollars with this control unite vice the 200+ for the ""professional"" gear.  This is an industrial grade temperature control unite for 1/3 of the price.  Go with this and you won't be sorry."
"187","This item has worked perfectly.  I bought a chest freezer to use as my kegerator and it keeps the temp right where I put it."
"188","I order this temp controller to regulate a refiguator at a wider tempature range. This first unit arrived and I installed it. It worked for the first cycle, but would not cool after that. Exchanged messages with the vendor and determined it was defective. They sent me a replacment quickly and has worked perfectly. Temp control is very accurate with plenty of options for diffrent setups with the digital readout. Other temp controllers I looked at did these functions or required to be hard wired into the system making them perminent, not what I was looking for."
"189","I attached this device to my deep freezer. The results were great. It maintains good temperature range with little work, just set it up and go. I use my chest freezer for lagering my home brew and have never veered off temperature with this thing. If you are looking for accurate results, I highly recommend getting one."
"190","Great product. be sure and read the instructions as you may need to change the jumpers for your application."
"191","This is the second unit I purchased and thru Amazon is the cheapest place to get them. It is very accurate and easy to set up. The issue with overshoot is a function of the freezer, that by the time it hits the set temp and shuts off the compressor, it is on its way down and can end up 2-5 degrees lower than desired. Overall, I am satisfied with the unit"
"192","Nice, easy to use for home brewing.  Instructions pretty clear.  Unfortunately, my unit seems to come with Fahrenheit only rather than the option to switch between F and Centigrade as the manual suggests."
"193","I use this to control a  aquaponics tank for Tillipa, works perfectly once you get it set up, I called johnson controls and they were the greatest to deal with, will buy more of there products if needed. Pay attention to the instructions and the jumper location and you will have no trouble, this unit will work for cooling as well as heating with the jumpers in the correct location.If you use the sensor submersed you must put it in some kind of tube, I took a piece of 1/2 copper and sweated a cap on the end, dropped the sensor down the tube and filled it with sand, works perfectly. Hope this was help to someone."
"194","Bought this controller to use on a Danby Kegerator.  The Danby had wide temperature variations and was consistently too warm resulting in foamy beer.  The controller worked perfectly to remedy the problem and give me cold beer with appropriate foam.  One note for anyone using the controller for a similar situation.  Some minor wiring is required to take control away from the Danby controller.  Detailed instructions are available online by searching for 'Danby Kegerator Improvements'.  Took about 5 minutes and was well worth the effort and the $."
"195","I, like others here bought this product as a DIY sous vide setup. I’m giving the product 5 stars because it did exactly what it said it would do. However, I ended up returning it. Here’s why: I used this in conduction with a (traditional Hamilton Beach) crock pot and it worked fairly well. The problem was, with my crockpot, the controller would shut off right at 130 degrees (for steak at medium rare) but the temperature would climb up to 134F before reversing course and falling back down. I contribute that to the design of the crockpot (where the heating element is outside of the thick porcelain), and so the product does exactly what it’s supposed to do but there’s a 4 degree swing with my setup. Considering the Sous Vide Supreme says it’ll keep the water within a half a degree F of the set temp, 4 degree swing was too much for me. I ended up setting the temp at 126 (to allow it to reach a max temp of 130.)So if A, you have a different heating element to keep the temp swings down or B, don’t mind 4 degree temp swings, this might work great for you."
"196","Bought this to control the temp in a chest freezer turned into a kegerator. Works perfectly, solid construction, and simple to set up and run. I've since bought several more for friends' kegerators."
"197","I needed a temperature control unit to turn a upright commercial freezer into a termperature control chamber for my conical fermenter.  What I especially appreciate about this unit versus the analog unit is the ability to see the actual ambient temperature where the thermocouple is located.  Also the wide range of temperature and Anti Cycle settings are a big plus."
"198","Didn't work. Returned"
"199","Purchased this last christmas as part of a keezer build. Quick and easy to install, and does a great job keeping the temperature regulated inside the chest freezer. I have never had anything remotely come close to freezing. Worth every penny."
"200","Used it to convert a stand up freezer into a refrigerator. Accurate and reliable. We used another relay instead of the built in one as the freezer pulled 25amps."
"201","great control for my keginator. works great!"
"202","I have 4 kegs of homebrew on tap at all times and this makes that all possible. I have helped several friends and family set up kegerators with this thermostat and a freezer as well. EricShirk.com"
"203","Love this controller!  I use it to control the temperature of the beer I make, to ensure it stays at a stable temperature in the fridge.  Works great!"
"204","i AM USING THE JOHNSON TO CONTROL THE TEMPERATURE OF MY FERMENTING BEER.  THE UNIT IS CONNECTED TO A PLASTIC HEAT WRAP FOR THE CARBOY. I WATCHED FOR A FEW DAYS TO SEE IT WAS ACCURATE.  THE ACCURACY ENDED UP WITHIN 1 DEGREE.  THE UNIT DOES HAVE TO BE OPENED UP TO MAKE THE CHANGE FROM HEATING TO COOLING. BUT THIS IS ONLY A 5+ MINUTE DEAL. COULD HAVE MADE A DIGITAL THERMOSTAT CONTROL UNIT, BUT FELT BY SHOPPING AROUND I WAS WITHIN $20 OF THE COST DIFFERENCE."
"205","Absolutely perfect for my needs.  Easy to use and has held up great.  I have no issues at all recommending this product to those in need of a temperature controller."
"206","this product works exactly as advertised. despite what others may post about the manual being too technical, setting up the unit was a breeze (desired temp, offset, etc aren't really difficult concepts). In hindsight, I do wish the chord for the temperature element was a few feet longer. The unit has been in use for about a month now on an upright freezer and functions flawlessly. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to run a freezer at warmer temps. Works great for beer fermentation chamber"
"207","GREAT BUY PRODUCT WAS EVERYTHING IN DESCRIPTION AND FOR THE BEST PRICE I COULD FIND. SATISFIED MY NEED FOR THE PRODUCT.THANKS! RECOMMENDED!"
"208","As described"
"209","I purchased the Johnson Controls Digital Thermostat Control Unit to do the temperature control on a deep freezer to kegerator conversion project.  It works exactly as like you expect it to.  Programming it was not trivial, but the manual is very useful, I had it working in about 20 minutes.  You will have to go through all the settings and what they mean (refer to manual) to get it set correctly (it's not obvious how to do it without it), but once it's set it works perfectly and doesn't require resetting, ever if it gets unplugged."
"210","Way better than the other kind I've been using. The override system works much more efficiently"
"211","Bought for home brewing to control temp! It is like a dream! Also use it for sous vide in my crock pot!"
"212","I use this to control the temperature of a heating mat placed under a 5 gallon carboy for brewing. It does the job perfectly!"
"213","Made a Kimchi Refrigerator out of a freezer with this, it is doing the job."
"214","It is so nice to walk out and have a home brew, on tap, at 40 degrees on a 90 degree day. I set this for storage at 68 degrees otherwise and it works great. Simple plug in operation and lcd readout."
"215","Been working great in my kegerator and purchased my second one,  for use in my deep freeze to lager my homebrew beer.  Very handy and accurate."
"216","Works great.  Like the fact that it has an offset so the compressor isn't kicking on every time the temperature changes 1 degree.  Very easy to use and accurate."
"217","It does exactly what it is supposed to do. The instructions were initially difficult to understand but once you reexamined what they were saying you just pull out the connector and viola... a perfect way to ferment beer at a temperature you desire without any massive fluctuations."
"218","This is quite expensive, however I have never been so happy with a thermostat. This thing is priceless"
"219","Holds temp like it should"
"220","I used this on a refrigerator to maintain a constant temperature to brew beer. I was very easy. Just plugged the refrigerator into the device.  Plug the device into the wall. Made a few control program changes for the temperature I wanted. It has maintained the temperature perfectly. There have been no problems with this unit."
"221","I bought this product for home brewing and use it with a mini fridge.  It is easy to adjust the temperatures on it and helps me keep my wort anywhere from 35 degrees to 65 degrees."
"222","Received the product exactly as advertised.Instructions are a little technical and do not explain everything perfectly but overall this is very easy to set up and can even be mounted to the wall or freezer.  I'm using it on a freezer to make it a refrigerator for extra efficiency.So far so good!"
"223","Using it in a chest freezer to control fermentation temps in south Texas. Aside from good sanitation practices fermentation control is crucial for home brewing and fermenting in ambient temps that don't coincide with your desired yeast temps are hard to control without a Johnson. Get one. Your home brew will thank you for it."
"224","I used this to convert my chest freezer into a kegerator. Its small enough to store inside the motor housing on the chest freezer. Its completely hidden and keeps my beer super cold."
"225","If you are converting a freezer to a keezer, this is what you need!  Really easy to program, adjust, and the temp probe cable is long enough to place it where you want it."
"226","This is a great product.  I have had no issues with this and the functionality is more than adequate for my chest freezer conversion to a kegerator.  Always holds a tight temperature tolerance."
"227","Easy to use, we are going to purchase a second one for our electric smoker.  This is a better fit than the controller that came with it"
"228","I have two of these for controlling beer fermentation and keezer temps.  Ultra simple, ultra reliable. Very happy with them."
"229","Easy to hook up and has successfully turned our chest freezer into a keezer!"
"230","Has turned fridge into a lager tun its awesome."
"231","We have been using this for about a month now. With a very large household, I needed a drink refrigerator that wouldn't cost a lot to purchase or to operate.Instead of buying a non-energy star $500 upright refrigerator/freezer that holds 14.2 cu ft in the frig section and costs $51/yr to operate under optimal conditions ($150/yr under heavy use), this control unit allowed me to take an energy star rated $300 15 cu ft chest freezer that costs $15/yr to operate as a freezer and turn it into a drink refrigerator. Based on the Kill-A-Watt data, it will cost me about $6/yr to operate it with heavy use.It does everything that it says it will do and does it well. It holds the temperature well while minimizing the wear and tear of the compressor."
"232","home made kegerator - great solid product"
"233","I bought this unit to convert a freezer to a 52 F lab chamber.  It set up easily and it works very well with a clear display.  I would have preferred more mounting options, as it is I just used clear packing tape to mount it to the side of the stainless steel freezer.Works well, solid construction, clear instructions, recommended."
"234","I use this for controlling a mini-fridge that I use for homebrewing. Super easy to use. You just plug in both ends, set the temp settings on the keypad, and you are set!"
"235","had this for a while now.  works great no problems"
"236","Well worth the money.  The most accurate thermostat so far.  The analog one isn't bad but this one is a little more reliable."
"237","I use it to control a 1500 watt heater in the chicken coop in winter.  Keeps a stable temperature.  Easy to program."
"238","Great unt have used it befor to control water temperature in our ultrasonic tanks"
"239","This works great on my chest freezer that I'm using as a fermentation chamber. It's a bit bulky, but overall it's pretty simple to use and is very accurate. Highly recommended for any homebrewers looking for a relatively inexpensive way to control temps."
"240","BEST THERE IS GOOD PRICE"
"241","Got this for a DIY sous vide setup.  Works flawlessly.  Excellent build quality."
"242","Hooked it up to a fermwrap for wine making.  Changed the jumpers for heating and it appears to work like a champ.  Holding steady at 72 degrees."
"243","Easy installation. Keeps your temperature floating around your desired temperature with minimal intervention on your part. Plus there is no need to install anything else to override your deep freezer's setup. Unlike other reviews, I haven't had a problem with short circuiting or sporadic failure after months of use."
"244","keeping my beer cold!!!! :)"
"245","Our fridge broke and we were able to use this to regulate the temperature until we could get a new one."
"246","Works Great"
"247","Works great with a thermowell but is a little bit of a pain to open up and move the jumper if you want to switch between heat mode and fridge mode frequently.  The versatility is awesome to have."
"248","Works AWSOME !"
"249","Work very well to maintain cooler temperatures in a chest freezer. Works great as a keg era to controller."
"250","Excellent high quality controller for my meat curing refrigerator."
"251","Excellent product!"
"252","Unit is simple and gets it right. I use it to control temperatures of chest freezers for fermenting, conditioning, and serving homebrew. I have three of them, and none of them have let me down! My requests to bring it to five stars would be...1. The ability to change between heating/cooling mode without unscrewing the unit and swapping little (delicate) pins around.2. Model option that allows for two stage temperature control, so that the same unit can control both a heating and cooling device. I currently have two of them side by side running my fermentation chamber - it needs to be cooled when the beer is actively fermenting, and heated once fermentation starts to subside.Highly recommended!"
"253","I used this to convert a chest freezer to a beer and wine storage unit. It keeps it within +/- 1 degree. Love it!"
"254","A must for a keezer. Keeps things right where I want it temperature wise with my freezer. Right around 37 degrees."
"255","Works perfectly, keeps my kegator at the perfect temperature all of the time.  Couldn't ask for anything more, a must have for all kegators"
"256","So far it's working great. I'm using as a controller for a propane gas valve for a smokehouse I just built."
"257","Using it to control refrigerator in brewing lager beer."
"258","This portable digital thermostat is easy to program and simple to operate.  I highly recommend it to anyone who needs a portable environmental control device."
"259","If your looking for something to regulate your new temp this is the perfect tool. It works like a charm"
"260","Bought this as a gift for my home-brewing husband.  Loves it!!  He uses it with every beer he ferments. Great product!"
"261","I have two of these on two different chest freezers to ferment and store homebrewed beer.  They work great."
"262","Keeps kegerator at the correct temperature."
"263","This is one well built unit.  Very professional and easy to use."
"264","Works as advertised. this truly is the best controller out there."
"265","With a little imagination this device can do just about anything with a 110v heating or cooling device.  I have made yogurt and sous vide with a crockpot but am moving on to making beer and who knows what else..  If you need a controlled temp this will likely do it."
"266","EXCELENT FOR BREWING FRIDGE WORKS GREAT"
"267","Price and performance unbeatable.  I shopped around and got this at close to analog price.  Only other option was building my own"
"268","If you're a homebrewer like me but not the most handy when it comes to wiring like some other controllers... this is the one for you! Very easy to use, instructions make programming a breeze. Have used for lager fermentation as well as for dispensing homebrew on draft! Temp is spot on.It's a little on the expensive side, but it is an excellent product!"
"269","I bought this for my cheese cave. I<m an artisan cheese maker and I need some very precise temperature control for aging cheese. I bought a cheap 35-bottle wine cooler with an analog/manual temp control. Since I've added the Johnson controler, the temperature has been stable by 1C variance. Very good! I couldn't ask for a better performance."
"270","I use this as a back-up thermostat for my entire snake room.  After figuring out how to use it(yes you actually have to read the instructions carefully!), using it was easy, and the probe is very sensitive and quick to respond to temperature changes."
"271","It works but needs skill and understanding from professional knowledge."
"272","Been using it now for a couple of years with my kegerator. Works great. Keeps my frosty brews at just the right temp."
"273","1"
"274","This worked so well, I bought a second one. Easy to set up and maintains a steady temp. I use mine  with a fermwrap around my carboy and it really raised my fermentation game."
"275","I bought this unit (twice!) to use as a temperature regulator for an upright freezer that I converted for use as a beer fridge. As such it is fantastic. In college, we used one of these units to cool our inexpensive light beer for parties. Say what you will about Natural Light---it is quite delicious when served at exactly 37 degress farenheit. This device makes that reliably possible, on a buget.To ensure that our beer was neither too cold nor too hot, I also purchased a wireless dual-thermometer set Chaney Instrument 00985 Wireless Refrigerator Freezer Thermometer Alarm Set. In retrospect, I did not need the thermometers: this Johnson Controls thermostat alone did a phenomenally accurate job of getting everything to the right temperature and keeping it there.If you are constructing a kegerator, or trying to brew your own beer, you want a freezer and this device. Refrigerators simply do not allow the precision temperature control and cooling cut-in/cut-out that this device allows for. Heck, you could use it to control a heat source such as in Sous Vide cookery if you are into that kind of thing. I can't speak authoritatively to other uses, but if you need to regulate a refrigeration device with the utmost precision, this device is exactly what you need."
"276","I've owned this unit for a few years now.  Works like a charm.  No problems, keeps the temperature correct for beer."
"277","Does a decent job of keeping slow cooker temps at set temp levels but is a bit hard to operate."
"278","Just what I needed. This is was exactly what I was looking for.  I would recommend this buyer to a friend."
"279","Still working 2 years later"
"280","Great product.  Less expensive than some similar digital options, but still performs admirably.  Most important for me, it is relatively easy to modify the wiring for several different applications (easy jumper settings for heating, cooling, cut-in, cut-out, but also able to reconfigure power or sensor cable as needed).  You'll be happy with this one."
"281","Did exactly what I wanted and expected it to."
"282","Nothing really to say, other than what is in the title. The instructions are a bit confusing for us non-engineer types, but by just experimenting with it I could figure it out. I use mine to keep my keezer in the 36-40 d F range and has worked flawlessly for the past month. I am happy with the purchase."
"283","So far so Good. very little set up time required, decent instructions I had it out of the box and controlling my fridge's temperature they way I needed it to be done in less then 20 minutes. The digital display is a great feature and I can monitor the temperature whenever I like. when and if  I need another thermostat controller for future projects I will buy the same one."
"284","This product works exactly as advertised and is very easy to install.  It has maintained my chest freezer at 60F in my garage in South Florida.  I can now brew lagers!!! very happy."
"285","I got 2 of these and they work perfect. I have not had an issue with them in the 2 or 3 years I have had them."
"286","Has kept a constant temperature in my fridge for 6 months now. Setup was easy."
"287","Okay - if you brew  your own beer or if you own a kegerator...  ...this thing is the trick.  I set mine at 32 degrees, plugged in my Keezer and the thing worked perfectly."
"288","A bit cumbersome with all the wires but it works great and I have been making delicious food."
"289","Works great. Glad I purchased the completely assembled controller. Had it running the  fridge with an hour after it arrived. Works perfect.  Takes all the hassle out of keeping the beer at the correct fermentation temp. The price was great also."
"290","This temp controller is as good as it gets. I'm using it for my chest freezer turned kegerator and it works perfectly. I looked at some other models, but what I liked about this one was the fact that its usable right out of the box, no wiring necessary. Its really easy to use and adjust. I'd recommend this to anyone."
"291","i loved this temp control cooler, using it for my home brews and it works great."
"292","Have had this for a while now and it works flawlessly."
"293","Ordered this control to regulate fluid temperature. It works for that, although I can find no info as to whether the sensor is submersible or not. Probably not, though it still works that way."
"294","We were turned on to this when our kegerator froze a couple of our kegs.  I would recommend this product for anybody with a smaller refrigerator.  The termostates in those are not high quality and most only have a reastat (cold to colder).  This unit has a digital readout so you can set the temperature exact with no concerns of your keg or sodas freezing!"
"295","Receiced very fast shipped and was very happy with product"
"296","This unit works great but it's really complicated. Even with the manual in your hands it can be difficult to understand. I actually used Google searches to fine tune mine similar to the way other mead home brewers had. This is what my brother had and he configured his for me until I got a replacement. It worked so well I bought the same model. As an aside make sure that you purchase one with all of the cabling. I accidentally got one without the cables at first that was just like this one (Same picture and everything) but cheaper."
"297","Still working good on our kegerator after a few years. good stuff."
"298","Will keep your keezer above freezing and has the settings to keep it from short-cycling."
"299","This is so cool. I wish I would have just got this from the very beginning. I would have saved more money in the long run."
"300","works great, keeps my beer at the proper temperature before I drink it!"
"301","Great temp control for my keezer conversion.  A little pricier than others but worth it in my opinion."
"302","Use this along with a Holiday 5.0 ft freezer to store kegs.  Works like a champ.  You may need to play with the placement of the temperature probe.  I found that suspending it about 4 to 5 inches from the bottom is ideal."
"303","Using this to control heating pads under small plants to control soil temp.  Had it programmed and controlling the pads in less then 5 minutes.  Simple to use and program."
"304","Universal thermostat. Cooling and heating.. I think it has differential adjustment also.Used to convert refrigeration to freezer. Door on Top."
"305","fermented 2 different beers so far, and now that I know this works this well, more brewing will be commencing shortly!"
"306","Lager beers will flow like a river from my new garage Lager Station.  Works perfectly."
"307","Excelente Product"
"308","I'm just going to state this now: the unit works as expected now that I tore it apart and connected the wires that weren't connected. If I didn't have to do this, unit would have gotten at least 4 stars.Bought this unit for use with a keezer I'm building.First thing I noticed on powering it up was a blinking error code. Manual said error code was related to the sensor not working. Oh joy. So, I pop the unit open and find the temperature sensor is only connected with one wire. The other wire? It was disconnected and brushing up against the surface mount devices on the little main board. Scary fire hazard, especially when dealing with AC power. Luckily the manual/directions had the wiring diagram. Problem solved.The take away on this? Before using the unit make sure all the wiring is done properly."
"309","I purchased this Johnson digital thermostat control unit to convert a freezer to a refrigerator.  Although you will need to find a suitable place to drill a hole for the temperature probe without damaging the freezer's working parts it is easy to install.  Programing is simple and unit works as advertised."
"310","Originally used it for temp control for my home brew fermentation chamber, However I couldn't give it a full five stars because it only provides one part of the control (heating or cooling, not both at the same time).  I ended up selling mine and made my own homemade STC-1000 controller with a project box and other parts that all combined were about 60% of the cost of this unit.If ur looking for one way temp control, its simple, easy and effective right out of the box.  If your looking for more specific control, not just heating or just cooling, consider a dual purpose temp controller."
"311","A little complicated to set up but one I got it configured it works perfectly.  Do not buy unless you are confortable taking it apart and movingthejumper from one set of pins to another."
"312","Johnson Controls Digital Thermostat Control UnitThe unit was easy to program and seems to be working fine. You only need to set the temp. you want, unless you have some tight variables. I only wanted to control a refrigerator temperature to age cheese. I'm quite pleased!"
"313","Works great and may be getting another. Perfect for mini friges"
"314","Came on time. Everything worked like it should."
"315","Works perfectly!  Easy to use."
"316","Works great for a freezer converted to a refrigerator.  Has lots of options for controlling.  At 35F my food stays so much longer in my freezer chest converted to a refrigerator than in my upright refrigerator."
"317","Hooked this up to a $30 turkey cooker to make a cheap sous vide. Works perfectly."
"318","Works great, very customizable."
"319","I have had a few and they all work great!"
"320","Perfect! Thank you :)"
"321","A+A+A+A+A"
"322","I bought this unit to make a simple ""plug and play"" type controller to modify a freezer into a keezer for homebrewing. It is just that easy to use, (remember to read the instructions before initial start) and now I can have the temperature option to ferment lagers, or crash chill for bottling. This is the one to get, and this is the place to get it. Thanks!"
"323","Fermentation chamber running great."
"324","Works great.  Our little gecko stays warm.  The numeric display is a little hard to see in my situation but I don't need to really see it."
"325","Using this to control the temp in a home brew keezer. Works great !! Make sure to set the jumper configuration correctly."
"326","Fast shipping, product as expected"
"327","I love this, easy to use, made my stand up freezer a fridge in seconds!!"
"328","Product works great. Easy to set up. Installed in my new 7.0 cu-ft chest freezer that was on sale and for just over $200, I have a nice Korean style kim-je refrigerator. Foods seem to keep for ever. I would highly recommend for this purpose."
"329","What's to say! Since I'm already using one for my keezer, I already knew what to expect. I believe these are rated for 12 amps. The commercial refer that I acquired draws roughly 10.5 amps. So this may be an inexpensive experiment."
"330","The item was the controller, it was the less expensive alternative. Will not buy from that vendor again."
"331","Rugged yet small enough to be mounted on a micro fridge. Keeps my kegerator at a steady 37 degrees without overburdening the compressor."
"332","Works great I used it to turn an old freezer in to a great beer cooler."
"333","It works very well as advertised."
"334","i apprecite it"
"335","Im very sorry to inform you that the control does not work. One of the two control botton its stuck and its imposible to set a control temperatura."
"336","I cleaned up an old beaten kegerator. The on board thermostat kicked in at 40degF and wouldn't shut off until it reached 22degF. I feel so bad for that keg... The external thermostat solved all my problems: set the on board low temp (it's good at that), plugged in the digital thermostat slightly tweaked, which is easy, and all is well.Cheers."
"337","I used this for controlling the temperature of a refrigerator for homebrewing a lager beer. It worked great and I had no issues."
"338","I love this thing.  Super accurate and shipped fast.  I'm now making lagers and am able to cold crash my dry hopped beers to get good clear beer without expensive or time consuming filtratipn."
"339","As of now I am very pleased with this. I have been using it for a few months and could not be happier. As long as it lasts I will remain thrilled."
"340","works great to heat my mead along with a ferm wrap"
"341","I'm going 4 stars instead of 5 only because the instructions are not as stupid proof as I normally need. Probably better for someone with a bit more technical know-how, but I figured it out pretty easily. Item works great in making my Keezer a reality."
"342","I have 2 and they both work great."
"343","Built a fermentation chamber and currently using it to keep my fermentation at my desired temps. Working awesome."
"344","I bought this to convert a chest freezer to a kegerator for homebrewing.  It is very easy to set up and works just like it should.  I have had zero issues with this.  Also, I bought this on a Friday morning, and the package arrived the next day.  Still not sure how they did that.  I would recommend this."
"345","These work great, but don't let them get wet.  My first one fried when it got a little water on it, but it is still a good product"
"346","Works great for my keezer. Keeps my beer at the perfect temperature. If I ever build another one, I would buy this again."
"347","Just recieved this item not 3 days ago and have my first batch in my 22 cubic ft ferment fridge holding at a steady 67 degrees ..would recommend to anyone in warmer areas doing home brewing.And to top that off best price i have found on this already wired controller anywhere and the shipping was super fast got it in 2 days."
"348","I have this on a True Kegerator.  Very accurate and easy to use.  The dial style thermostat went bad so I bypassed that and I rewired compressor to the Johnson Control and fan separately so it stays on all the time.  Now I know exactly what temp the beer is at..  Great product."
"349","works great"
"350","I have it set on 68 for fermenting beer, and it fluctuates from 59 to 74...not acceptable, or what I expected for $80.  Only getting 1 star because it won't let me give 0"
"351","Using to convert a chest freezer into a wine chiller to be used in a winery. Digital readout makes it easy."
"352","Does the joob better than I expected it would maintains my freezer temperatures exactly where i want it to be. I turned my freezer into a kegerator using this handy dandy device worth every penny. I have it regulating my freezer temps at 38 degrees and it keeps my keg nice and cold! I have had it running for about 1 week and I am truely amazed. And the LCD display is so attractive and easy to use and the price was just so affordable. I recieved the unit 3 days before the estimated delivery date and I live in Hawaii."
"353","Product works as advertised. It is keeping my lager beer at 31-32 degrees consistently with no worries or temp fluctuations."
"354","Would like to give it five stars but found the directions a little confusing for me. After finding a demo on youtube it all made sense. Changed the factory set up and has been working perfectly. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to control a temperature to a high tolerance."
"355","This keeps my kegerator from freezing up"
"356","Perfect to turn my old chest freezer into a lager chest for beer making. Works great."
"357","This is exactly what you need if you want to turn a freezer into a ""keezer"" for home brewing.  Works great."
"358","Use this on my kegerator out in the garage. We live in the Houston area so obviously the garage is more hot year round than cold. Haven't had any issues yet. If you can plug an electrical cord into a wall socket, you can install this."
"359","Quality product that's been durable over time."
"360","Works great does what it say's it will do."
"361","I don't know a whole lot about these temperature control units but so far, it is getting the job done with no problems.  It was fairly easy to mount.  The directions are a little tough because they don't fully explain some of the features."
"362","I ordered this as a temp controller for a kegerator I built.  Following the instructions I had it up and running in no time.  It took about a day for the temps to stabilize but now it hold very nicely.  This is highly recommended for anyone who has built a kegerator for homebrewing beer."
"363","this product worked great.  simply plug unit into wall, plug fridge into thermostat.  run your probe in through the drain hole, ""at least that worked easy for my on my Danby minifridge.""  The menu takes about 5 mins for a chimp to figure out.  not very hard at all those that complain about its ""complexity"" I would question the rest of their review and if they should be bothering with building any project that deals with electricity...  Just read the manual included and it details what needs to be done.  this is a great setup!"
"364","Works exactly as advertised- Perfect!"
"365","it works"
"366","Perfect for my keezer (freezer / kegorator).  Keeps beer at a constant 40 degrees.  I couldn't be happier."
"367","Used it to control a new GE freezer to act as a root cellar. There are spots in the freezer bottom even though the probe is on the bottom, that froze water when set at 34. So the controller is set at 38 which has the unit running between 35 and 39 with no ice anywhere in the bottom of the freezer."
"368","Koreans usually contain our Kimchi in a Kimchi freezer that can maintain 0 degree Celcius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) accurately. Not only Kimchi but most vegetables and fruits are fresher in a Kimchi freezer than in a rough ordinary refrigerator that can only maintain temperatures in several degrees of wide range. Korean ancestors digged a ground hole and contained Kimchi there along the winter. Generally genuine Kimchi freezers have very accurate temperature controls but very expensive because of their unique freezing apparatus.One of Korean engineer in US (I can't remember him now, except he wrote his work in the missyusa website) made an idea that this Johnson Control Unit could be combined with a chest freezer to make a Kimchi freezer in a reasonable price. I made my own Kimchi freezer with Danby DCF700W1 7.0 cu. ft. Chest Freezer. Then I set the Johnson Control's target temperature to 34F, and squeeze the control range to just 1 degree. The Thermo-couple (temperature detector tip) is floated in the air of the center of the freezer. The machine's operating rule is very simple. Cooler than target temperature, switch off. Warmer than target temperature, swith on. All automatically.The result is awesome. The air temperature at the center of the freezer easily maintained from 29F to 34F. Womderful!p.s. However, I changed the setting to 36F to contain vegetables :)"
"369","I'm using this with my keg fridge that had a very poor temp control in it.  This is much better.Very easy to use and the setup.  The configurable deadband and min off times are very nice.I now have my beer at 0 to 1 degree without freezing, very very nice!"
"370","This controller is already wired, so all you have to do is plug it in and set your temperature through the digital display."
"371","Works perfectly out of the box. Easy to use, good instructions"
"372","Working great so far, let's hope it lasts a long time!"
"373","I chose this unit as I had seen it in action from other home brewers. It is simple to install, easy to set and is pretty much plug and play. It controls my 'Keezer' perfectly, and I never have to worry about temperature fluctuation. I will be buying another for my refrigerator so I can control it better as well. THIS UNIT IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST FOR HOMEBREWERS"
"374","This device, the Johnson Controls Digital Thermostat Control Unit, performs exactly as specified. If you need something like this device, this is the one to get."
"375","Ordered the A419, got the A421.  Giving it a try anyway."
"376","So far so good.  Does what it's supposed to do and seems well built.  My only mild complaints are that it seems a bit expensive and the directions are not as clearly written as they should be."
"377","This item did not work right out of the box. I have had a blue box Johnson Controls and it has worked for me for years. Spend the extra few bucks on that one."
"378","Great digital control, ought it so I am better able to have my homebrew fermenting at the proper temp.,loving it."
"379","It works perfect."
"380","Easy to use and set up. Exactly what is needed for keeping a freezer at temperatures as desired. Slightly bulky. But otherwise perfect."
"381","Bought this to accurately control the temp of my 5 cu ft chest freezer for home brewing lagers and Alt beers.Love it."
"382","This little unit does exactly what I needed.I use this for climate control in a small area.It works great. Instructions are easy and accurate."
"383","I have been using these in regulating temperature for my snakes for last few years, combine these with a radiant heat panel and I have had much success so far I have had 3 going for a year with no issues and will be getting a 4th."
"384","If you are a home brewer wanting to keep a chest freezer at the right temp to brew beer, this unit is for you.  No alterations to the freezer are required.  Plug the freezer to the temp controller, plug in the controller, press set set arrow up or down to temp desired, press set and you are done!  VERY simple!"
"385","Exquisite for homebrew purposes!"
"386","MUCH BETTER THAN EXPECTED FOR MY USE."
"387","good product"
"388","nice working !!!"
"389","I recommend this for the homebrewer who is looking to brew lagers, as is will more accurately control the temperature of your refrigerator/chest freezer."
"390","Works great for my kegerator."
"391","Works great.  If you need a controller that is temperature controlled this does the job.  Easy to operate and set."
"392","I initially thought I was going to need to wire it into the power cord on my freeze myself, but it was actually a simple plug and play. Easy to follow directions for setting your control settings made it that much easier. I couldn't be happier."
"393","Excellent device, simple to use, does what it says on the box, just plug and play.  Perfect for controlling freezers for fermenting and largering"
"394","This controller is hooked up to my mini-fridge for lagering  my beer.  Works well.  I would like to see the manual written with more user friendly language."
"395","Plugged it into to a cheap 5 cubic ft freezer to keep keg/fermenter at optimal temperature.  Very easy to use digital interface, no need to wire anything manually."
"396","Directions are complicated"
"397","Used this device to build a home made kegerator and it works very well. Will buy another when I finally put my lagering system together."
"398","Works great"
"399","Great quality.  This is easy to set up and can very accurately hold my fermentation temps within 1-2 degrees.  Will do heating mode or cooling mode."
"400","I use this weekly with a cheap slow cooker/croc pot. It keeps temperature very well and the probe is easy to place."
"401","Have been using this for over a year now and it still works great. It was a little hard to figure out the programming but it does it's job."
"402","one for fermentation and one for your keezer. this thing rocks and this was the lowest price on the net."
"403","I bought this controller to convert my chest freezer to a keezer for my kegged home brewed beer. It was easy to understand the instructions and program for the ideal temperature I needed for an optimum pore! I plan to order another in the future to control my fermentation chamber ."
"404","best I've found for the money"
"405","HAVE ONLY HAD THE ITEM FOR A FEW WEEKS, BUT IT WORKS WELL AS DESCRIBED."
"406","Works.  Easy to setup if you're using for controlling cooling."
"407","Got this for my Keezer build. ""Plug and play"", just as I was hoping! Since installation temps have been consistent. Will be getting another for fermentation controll."
"408","I purchased this control to regulate the temperature in my old refrigerator that I wanted to cure meat in. So far, I have used it fora couple of weeks and it is doing the job! It is very easy to set up and it does keep the temperature where I have programmed it."
"409","Works great to keep my lager at stable temperatures.  I checked it regularly for the first three weeks of owning this product and have never seen it different than 54 degrees (I set it at 55 degrees).Excellent for use with a freezer chest for lagering and storing kegs. Definitely recommended.  I have not drilled a hole in my freezer chest yet, so I close the lid on the probe, which crimps the cord a little bit, but works just fine for my purposes."
"410","Easy to set up, controlled my heating system to within +/- 2 F."
"411","works great on my Keezer.  its keeping my beer at 30 degrees.."
"412","I bought this device to override the thermostat in a wine fridge that I use as a beer fermentation chamber.  The fridge has analog controls that are not precise.  This product was easy to set up using the included instructions, and has so far worked like a champ."
"413","Great price works as advertised."
"414","works great and easy to use. definitely worth the extra $20 or so to upgrade from the analog/dial version. This is much more accurate. The other version works good enough though, you just need a thermometer to double check everything."
"415","Great for my kegerator."
"416","Unit works great. Using it to ferment ale in an old refrigerator in a metal shed in the Arizona desert with outside temps of 105F. Unit is fully adjustable to fit all your brewing needs."
"417","Great device, Instructions for setting the dip switches would have been a plus.... Does what it is suppose to do....."
"418","This is a great product and it is still being used for other project's."
"419","Bought this to convert a chest freezer into a refrigerator it. So far it works great no problems and would definitely buy more from Johnson controls"
"420","I have been using the product for about a month. Works well so far. It is very critical tool for my lager brewing."
"421","This seems to be a professional grade temperature controller.  I had major issues with the cheap kegorator I got from Walmart, but this controller and a cheap 4 inch plastic electric fan has turned it into a dream beer machine!"
"422","This Johnson Controls Digital Thermostat is fantastic!!  I converted my small chest freezer to a refrigerator using this device.  Now I use the freezer/refrigerator to keep my home brewed beer at the perfect temperature.  Easy setup and forget about it.  Very easily adjust the temp if you want to."
"423","Turned an old refridgerator into a red wine storage cooler. Keeps temp at perfect long term storage temp of 55 degrees."
"424","works as stated and is a quality product.  directions could be better but with time you can figure it out"
"425","Excellent to keep temperatures accurate on kegerator."
"426","it's awesome-easy to use...a great product.  installed magnetic strips on the back and positioned the unit for better visibility."
"427","I have been using this Thermostat for aging beer in an old fridge - works perfectly.  Super steady and reliable (going on 3 years now since purchase)."
"428","Product works great"
"429","Easy set up and then forget. It takes the hassle out of temp control when homebrewing. Worth the investment for serious homebrewers."
"430","Works well, though I wish the instructions were a little easier to comprehend."
"431","I have two of them, great for aging beer."
"432","The unit was not what it should have been. I called Johnson Control and the service man said that I had a bad unit after I described how it came to me.  Jumpers to allow changiing the mode of operation were not included with the unit.  I will never purchase this type of product again from Amazon.  iF YOU DO BUY ONE TAKE IT APART TO MAKE SURE JUMPERS ARE INCLUDED WITH IT OTHER WISE ITS IS USELESS. SEND IT BACK IMMEDIATLEY OR YOU WILL BE LIKE ME HOLDING A PIECE OFJUNIK THAT CAN NOT BE RETURNED,.  Please disregard the above.  After I found a you tube video showing how to change the mode of operation, I realize that I did not understand what I saw in the instruction manual and described it incorrectly to the people at Johnson Control.  The unit works exactly as it it should and I would recommend it to any home vinter  or home brewer to control temperature in either hobby.  I would recommend any one using the controller to watch the you tube videos on how to operate it and how to change from the cooling mode it comes set at to the heating control mode."
"433","Works great, the functions are not very intuitive though, need to use manual to create settings. performs well and looks nice."
"434","Works perfect for a keezer build"
"435","Works prefect.  I was scared that my fridge might explote or get damage but not issues at all. It have several options to get just the right temp for my fermenters."
"436","Good product -I'm happy"
"437","Idiot proof, huge improvement over previous generations, where an electrical back ground was required to hookup the controller.Instructions were clear and easy to follow"
"438","Using it to help comvert an old freezer into a kegorator.  Instructions are a bit complicated, but figures/images quickly clarify.  Allows user to adjust cycle timing & precision range, which the analog (non-digital) versions dont offee.  Overall a nice controller for the money given what i have seen."
"439","I use this for home brewing. I had to change the jumpers over to fit may needs, which was very easy to do. I use this on a chest freezer turned keezer and will be purchasing another for a fermentation chamber."
"440","Works exactly as advertised.  I plan on purchasing two more of these devices.  Current purchase keeps a 7 cu. ft. freezer at 42 degrees."
"441","Working fine!"
"442","Works great easy to set up. For three months now I have been using it to ferment or store home brew."
"443","Yes great. Thank you."
"444","This product was described well, shipped quickly, and arrived is new condition - The product itself is really excellent and allows you to set a frezzer at any temperature - so you can use the freezer as a Frig @ very economical price - good seller!"
"445","great!!"
"446","Works great!!! Keeps chest freezer at perfect temps for fermenting beer.  Highly recommend it.  You can't go wrong ordering this controller."
"447","Using as a temperature control for my kegerator and it does a great job at keeping a consistent temperature even in a fridge from the 1950's!"
"448","The product worked fine, temps were accurate, but it quit working after 8 months.The digital screen indicated it was on and working but it was not passing voltage to my keezer. It was summer and my beer got warm!!!I would expect a little more durability from a trusted name like Johnson Controls."
"449","Works well, very easy to program and I like that it shows current temp."
"450","Works perfectly, very flexible in setting up, you do have to read the instructions to position the internal jumpers correctly."
"451","Works extremely well.  Easy to use.  Don't let the probe get wet.  Put is in a bag with a rubber band on it."
"452","I highly recomend this product, GREAT for home brewers that want to convert a refridgerator to a cold brewing chiller"
"453","Just what I need for a fermentation chamber to keep my home brewed beer at a constant temperature. This thing is great."
"454","terrific product, very precise at maintaining temperature in an old refrigerator."
"455","Allows me to use my upright freezer as a fridge. Great product."
"456","Works great for my hydrographics tank."
"457","This thermostat worked great for my keezer, very simple to program.  The only thing I would change would be to lower the price, but great product."
"458","Very good!"
"459","Item was sent in a timely manner. Quality of unit is just that ""Quality"". I especially like the fact it has dual functions. Heat and Cooling!"
"460","This works great controlling the temperature for brewing my beer."
"461","Easy to set up and use with clear instructions. This will help to make my home brews turn out consistently delicious each and every time."
"462","Solid unit, using it to keep my homebrew temperature controlled."
"463","The product works well enough for the price I guess. My big concern is that I have the differential set to 1 degree, yet the controller consistently takes my keezer down 7 degrees below my set-point. This concerns me when I'd like to ferment a lager at a consistent temp yet the chamber is varying by 7 degrees throughout the day. At least it works (kinda) and is easy to set-up."
"464","Building my fermentation chamber now. Can't wait to test this unit out."
"465","As a home brewer I need temp controls. I have one on my keezer for tapping and one on my fridge for fermentation temps. The name Johnson should say it all."
"466","Works like a charm."
"467","Perfect for controlling the Fememtation temp of your freezer, fridge or heater. Easy to use and rock solid. Wired is the way to go!"
"468","I use this controller to maintain proper temperatures during the lagering of beer I make.  Performs as required with very little maintenance adjustments.  Pretty much set and forget."
"469","It does exactly what it says it does"
"470","Showed up and worked as advertised. Plugged in my chest freezer and easily set up the temp I wanted (after placing the probe inside). I now have a steady temp for my home brew keezer!"
"471","I am using this thermostat to convert a chest freezer to a kegerator. The thermostat is very well built and easy to use. It takes only a few minutes to understand the basic programming. I had it up and running in minutes and has been working flawlessly."
"472","Very good product."
"473","I used this on a refrigerator that I wanted to maintain at a higher temperature to age cheese.  It couldn't have been easier.  Just plug the refrigerator into it.  Plug it into the wall and you are set. It has maintained the temp perfectly."
"474","The keg-o-rator that I purchased for my new kitchen 3 years ago was either freezing the beer in the keg or not keeping it cold. I decided to install this thermostat myself and now things are perfect."
"475","This controller works great.  A little confusing to set up but we figured it out."
"476","I did not get this for a kegerator, but for a bullet lube heater.  The Johnson unit can be changed from cool mode to heat mode simply by changing a jumper.  It took less than 60 seconds to convert it to heating mode.  The vendor had installed a line in pigtail and a line out pigtail, and sold it for less that I could find it for for just the control by itself.  This is an excellent deal all the way around.  I ordered this on the 31st of May, it shipped June 1 and I received it June 2.  This has to be some kind of record.  Great product, even better vendor.  If you need a line voltage temperature control, grab one, you won't find a better product, better vendor or better deal for the money anywhere else.  it did not come with a manual, but for a complete set of instructions go to Johnsons web site.[...]"
"477","Installed this device on a commercial 2 door freezer  to convert it to a refrigerator.  Easy to install and works great"
"478","Attached it to an upright freezer and it makes a great kegerator! This is the second of these units I have purchased to create a couple of kegerators"
"479","Used to larger home brew with a small dorm style refrigerator works  as advertized  easy to use. Can 't Waite to try my first larger."
"480","Using for a home brew keezer and works great!! Just started using a few weeks ago, but at this point, definitely recommend!"
"481","Easy to install works well and keeps the temperature where you set it."
"482","nice product"
"483","I bought this to try souse vide cooking at home.  With a crock pot or roaster as the water bath plugged into the control unit, it works great."
"484","I use the Johnson control thermostat  for controlling heating devices for my reptile cages they are accurate and dependable and very easy to use. I would recommend anyone  for the use of this product."
"485","Very good product"
"486","super easy to hook up, had to think about programming for just a minute, but easy once you think about it. Use it to control my beer fermenting fridge."
"487","Simple setup and has been working perfectly. Plugged it into my chest freezer to store kegs"
"488","This thing works great.  My only real concern with it is that fact that a lot of laypeople (myself included) use them for brewing and the instruction manual is aimed at end-users who are experienced with very dense technical instructions.I'm not saying that's a 'bad' thing, just something to think about.  Considering the prevalence of these devices in homebrewing/non-industrial scenarios, a quick user's guide would be awesome to include with it.  Also, if you're using this device as a HEATING controller rather than a COOLING controller (its default state), you will need to open the case and move some small jumpers around."
"489","Perfect for keeping things warm or cold. I use it for beer brewing both winter and summer. Might buy another to do some stepped fermentation."
"490","I use this thermostat to control temperature of my beer chest.  Set it and forget it."
"491","Great product!"
"492","Shipped with great care! Couldn't be happier with the unit. Ease of set up, functionality, and very user friendly highlight the unit."
"493","Well made- so far, accurate and easy to use and program once you figure out the abbreviations. Does what its suppose to without fuss."
"494","This unit has functioned exactly as stated.  It has allowed me to make a standard fridge into a very functional ""cheese cave"""
"495","this works great i put it on a frige to brew lager beer it keeps the temp within 1 deg. of the temp needed for lagering"
"496","Great item.  It worked perfectly on my 1950s Coke refrigerator which had been freezing my pop/beer. Now my drinks are ice cold."
"497","Extremely easy to install.  Drilled one hole in chest freezer and was good to go.  I have it set at 38 degrees as the max.  I kept an eye on it pretty close the first couple of days and it drops to about 36 degrees.  Highly recommend if building a kegerator."
"498","Great controller, one month using it perfectly."
"499","This works so much better than the analog version for only ten bucks more.  The directions are easy to figure out and the line in to the freezer is very flexible."
"500","This unit(kit) works great, just plug and done."
"501","If you are looking to make a Kagerator out of a freezer this is the product to do it"
"502","Works great. I use it in heating mode no problem. Maintains 85 degrees nicely."
"503","good work and delivery.. I love this"
"504","Does an excellent job and is a heavy duty product"
"505","I got this unit because the stat on my kegerator was all over the place Great job it works great it keeps my beer just the right temp and fast shipping"
"506","WORKS GREAT"
"507","Easy to set up. Works great so far."
"508","Now I can brew lagers and condition beer at the proper temperature. I'm very satisfied. Straightforward piece of equipment that I really need."
"509","Easy to use, works wonderful at keeping temperature within 1 degree.  Couldn't ask for a better product.  I will recommend this product to anybody looking to control refrigerator/freezer temperatures."
"510","It worked just as expected. My friend had one. That is how I found obout it."
"511","Easy to use and is working well in my keezer"
"512","I purchased this to control the temperature in a keezer I'm building. So far it is maintaining a temperature of 45 F in my converted freezer very well."
"513","Work good and easy to setup, little pricie but I guess you get what you pay for."
"514","Used it for a home made solar pool heater. Works great"
"515","After calibration, works as advertised."
"516","Turned a small fridge into a cheese cave. East to use and works great. Just plug it in, set the temp and you are good to go."
"517","Perfect for keeper or ferm chamber, accurate, easy to control. Fast shipping and easy setup, ability to do cooling or heating, great value"
"518","Put this on a used Kegerator that had a bad TC.  Controls very nice and it was very easy to set up!  Very pleased"
"519","i purchased my A419 from learn_to_brew and worked great up to 3 weeks ago. By using my meter it seems as though the switch that sends 120v to the output cord has failed. I then contacted Johnson Controls after following the simple troubleshooting steps, with some more failure validation tips, Customer Service informed me that i had to go through the vendor from Amazon.I e-mailed them (learn_2_brew) with no other re-course and they replied that the 90 return policy had expired. my question was about help with the warranty. they obviously don't stand behind the product that they sell. i must now find a local dealer/distributor to see if they will honor the 3 year warranty."
"520","I have had great success using this in conjunction with a large crock pot for a homemade sous vide water oven. It controlled the temperature of water in my crockpot very well and so each thing I cooked using the sous vide method turned out perfectly. By default the unit came to me with the jumper set to turn off when the temperature dipped to a certain level. Since I wanted it to turn off when the temperature rose to a certain level I had to adjust a jumper, but this was fairly easy. Dialing in the temperature cutoff and range was also easy.I'm also interested in using this for beer brewing, to precisely control the temperature of a freezer or refrigerator, and possibly for an aquaponics experiment (cleaning fish water with vegetables and feeding vegetables with fish water) in the future. This device was exactly what I was looking for and I would recommend it for a wide range of uses!"
"521","The product is good overall.  The settings take some time to understand.  The manual is written too technically specific and not for the normal non-electrician."
"522","so far so good, i bought it to control the temp on a chest freeze.  converted one into a keezer"
"523","Don't worry about it, it works.  it keeps my beer freezer 1 degree around where I would like it. w"
"524","Working very well and holds temp accurately"
"525","Works exactly as advertised and easy to program.  I currently use it to control the temerpature on a home made fermentation unit."
"526","Works as promised. Instructions could be more user friendly."
"527","Have many never a problem!"
"528","Works great!"
"529","works great use it for keeping 5.0 cubic freezer at 36 degrees for beer"
"530","Worked as advertised, shipping was fast."
"531","This was easy to set up and use.  I use it for controlling a small wine refrigerator for brewing beer."
"532","Does everything it was expected to"
"533","Great product"
"534","Great"
"535","Happy so far, I would recommend this device"
"536","I used this along with a Hydor Koralia Nano 240 Aquarium Circulation Pump and a NORPRO 559 Immersion Heater to convert an old cooler into my first sous vide cooker. Works great"
"537","It meet my expectation, thanks.  yyh"
"538","This is amazing gazette."
"539","All good"
"540","Great product.  Easy to use and set up."
"541","Excellent!"
"542","My keezer is now complete"
"543","Happy, shipment was Jimmy Johns fast"
"544","thanks"
"545","Unit worked great"
"546","So good"
"547","This thermostat is a great item!  I've been using it for months now to keep my mini fridge at the optimal temperature for homebrewing.  I've used it for making ales, as well as lagering and am very satisfied.  It is easy to program and use.  The temperature is very precise as well."
"548","I tried using this for a compact fridge for home brewing. The first time around, this product keep the fridge at just the right temperature. The second time around, it inexplicably entered into heating mode, and it does not respond to the proper jumper configurations outlined in the user manual. Now it just functions as a very expensive and otherwise useless thermometer. A very expensive single use."
"549","certainly it keeps the fridge temperature controlled, however the fridge will not necessarily starts once the controller provides the power, but that could be an issue with the fridge itself. The controller has done it's job"
"550","This thermostat control unit is being used in my new keezer and works great! The initial setup took a little reading, but I figured it out. It kicks on when temps get above 42 (where I have it set) and turns off the freezer when it's cold enough again. Perfect!"
"551","Works good but wish I would've bought an InkBird dual temp controller for 1/2 the cost."
"552","Using to regulate the temp of my kegerater.  Current refrigerator didnt have a digital thermostat - just a dial from cold to coldest.  This keeps the fridge/ kegerater exactly within the easy to program temp range.  It could not work better. Would also work great for an in-wall AC unit."
"553","I bought this to convert a chest freezer to a refrigerator. It works in this capacity to a degree. We end up with endless condensation buildup inside the chest, causing rust. It also cycles in a way that we get some freezing, so we lose veggies to damage. It was an experiment that's lasted just over a year. We saw our electric bill drop by $60 a month, but also saw our food losses increase substantially. It would work great in this application if you can drain condensation and aren't refrigerating fruits and vegetables in it."
"554","my probe melted against the side of a crock pot set on low."
"555","Bought this unit from the beverage factory to control the cooling system for an entertainment cabinet. It is small, easy to program and very versatile. Worked beautifully for 6 months. Now it runs the cooling system constantly, full on all the time. I have pulled the jumpers to reset it and it will function properly for about an hour, after an hour it will turn on and never turn off. There are no error codes and the only indication there is a problem is that the LED indicator is not lit while it is running. When functioning properly the LED indicator is lit the whole time the unit is running. I had hoped that it would have lasted longer. Searching for an inexpensive alternative at this time."
"556","Awesome for my freezer fermenter."
"557","The instructions could be more clear for this product. I had to search for a how-to video on youtube in order to better understand how to set this up. Also, I am having trouble with the refrigerator heating up to the set point. It is in a cold room, about 15 F below the set point but has not come within 10 F of the specified set point and cutout."
"558","Took a bit of figuring to set it up the way I wanted it to work, but it is great and works perfect"
"559","works like its supposed to"
"560","Easy to turn this into a heating controller for your crockpot or rice cooker.  Controls water bath temp to 1 deg.  Perfectly cooked meat every time.  Save $25 off the price over at dorkfood dot com."
"561","Perfect for our kegerator! Worth the money! Followed the directions, installed, and have not touched sense! ~Never had any issues. VERY ACCURATE!"
"562","It seems to work great just be advised if you use it for reptiles you may have to change it from cool to heat by switching pins inside unit."
"563","good"
"564","I use it for cold.I use it for hot.I use it a lot.I like it!I love it!I'm glad that I boughtum...it.  :-s"
"565","Works great-a little hard to set-up w/ the instructions but figured it out. Once dialed in it works perfect! I used this on an old fridge w/ a bad stat."
"566","Thanks goes out to the other reviewer who commented on using this for sous vide.  I just wanted to add my delight with this.  I had been doing what I was calling ""poor man's sous vide"" with my crock pot set to warm (would keep water bath around 145 degrees) and decided it was time to get more control.  This thing works great.  For those that are comparing to the other sous vide temperature controller that some reviewers said was loud when switching - I think this unit's switching click is pretty reasonable.  Yes you have to read a pretty involved manual to get this into heat mode, but it's really just a matter of unscrewing the controller and finding the pin they show in the instructions and just putting it into a different place with your fingers.  Easy and straight forward once you read.I'm off to buy another one as a gift for a friend with a non-digital crock pot like mine that wants to try sous vide cooking."
"567","Ordered it on 6/27/12 and had it in-hand on 6/30/12. Talk about fast order processing and shipping!! Nice! I was a little concerned about user friendliness of this model based on some online reviews/complaints. Bottom line is if you can read, aren't an idiot, and can in read above a 6th grade level you'll be fine with the instructions this unit comes with. Once I read the manual and made a few adjustments, this thing is doing exactly what I want it to do. I'm a home brewer who converted a 7cf chest freezer to a kegerator. I was able to set it to 37 degrees fahrenheit (df) with a 2 df differential and a 3 minute start delay in a matter of a few minutes (literally). I double checked its temp accuracy with a Thermoworks 2k thermocouple and this control unit was within 1 df of my thermocouple, so I know it's accurate. I would highly recommend this product."
"568","Temperature controller arrived as advertised and works great!! This is a definite game changer for my fermentation vessel. I couldn't be happier!"
"569","Its easy to use...the manual makes it seem overly complicated.SP: setpoint (for my purpose 67) the temperature you want the thing to try and maintain.dIF: differential (1 to 30F, default = 5) I leave at default, this is the point + or -  from the setpoint temp (so 62 to 73 in my case.ASd: anti-short cycle delay (0 to 12 minutes, default = 1)I set to 12 minutes, just to put the least amount of stress on the compressor.I recommend it!"
"570","I just purchased this unit and installed it in my Keezer and it is not working properly.  Sometimes it keeps the temperature and then it goes way beyond the set limits. I contacted Johnson controls and they gave some crappy answer that I need to contact the manufacture of the freezer!! What has that do with the controller? Not happy but need this unit for the Super Bowl. I will never buy their product again"
"571","It's not keep temperature that I set. I put this one into chest freezer to keep 34 degree, but fluctuating to 27-37. Really frustrating."
"572","THE JOHNSON A-419 IS THE PERFECT TOOL TO TURN YOUR FRIG INTO A REGULATED BEER FERMENTER IF YOU LIVE IN AREAS OF HOT WEATHER. IT'S INSTRUCTIONS ARE A LITTLE OVER THE HEAD OF MOST HOME OWNERS AND HOP JUNKIES) BUT ONCE YOU WORK THROUGH THE DETAILS IT WORKES PERFECTLY."
"573","very good product"
"574","works great. I like it"
"575","Lasted a very short period of time."
"576","Works sometimes."
"577","Great product dose what it supposed to."
"578","Works great."
"579","sweet."
"580","Good"
"581","The unit worked great for about a year. I went to check the temp and the display was off and the unit somehow fried. I have tried everything and it is gone. This is BS considering this controller was like 75 bucks."
"582","in at least 20 words, this item was exactly as represented.  it arrived quickly, undamaged, and wrapped very well.  i trust it work, i haven't hooked it up yet."
"583","Did nothing to solve my problem with my kegerator."
"584","This product lasted about 20 days. Worked fine, hooked to the kegerator. Then came home and it was completely dead. No display, nothing. Ruined a full keg of nice oatmeal stout."
"585","If you check most homebrewing sites, this is the temperature controller that you'll see recommended.  Well, I am going to recommend against it based on my experiences.I ordered mine less than a year ago and the temperature probe no longer works.  I discovered this by opening up my chest freezer, which I had set to stay at about 40 degrees.  It had dropped below freezing, freezing most of the beer in my kegs and bursting most of the bottles I'd been storing in the freezer turned kegerator.This is not the only reason I am giving this one star.  I understand that mechanical problems happen.  I contacted the seller, ""learn_to_brew"" for any advice or help on this.  The responses were not helpful and I was told to contact the manufacturer, Johnson Temperature controls.  I looked them up and attempted to contact them, and their website gives me an error.  I've tried multiple times on two different browsers and I can't even contact them about this defective product.And looking at the other reviews, I am not the only one to have this sort of problem with the unit breaking.So, here's the rundown:- product seems prone to break, which is not good if you are using it in a homebrew or keg storing context.- seller is not helpful when it breaks.- and it is not possible to contact the manufacturer.Sounds like 1 star to me.  Avoid."
"586","I use the Johnson Controls A419 Thermostat to control the heat in my snake (ball python) cages.  The instructions are a bit confusing. *Tip* In order to switch the device to heat and to have the heat source turn off once the high is met you have to move both jumpers.  Other than the instructions being confusing the device runs perfectly.  It keeps my snakes in the right heat range without fail.  I would recommend this device to any reptile owner.  Additionally, I have been using them for about a year and they are holding up very well, and they clean easily.  Great thermostat I love the fact that if one should fail in the future I only need to buy one, vs. a more expensive ""herp"" thermostat that controls several heat elements leaving several animals in danger."
"587","Good temp controller for brewing beer. Holds the temp with a few degrees of the set temp. Have been testing it in a deep freeze at various temperatures. So far so good. Looking forward to using it to brew some beer that requires colder temperatures for fermentation."
"588","Bought two of these units to control heaters in my two greenhouses.  Previously I'd been using prewired dial thermostats that had about 20 degree error between operating point and dial indicator.  Time to step up to the Johnson Controls unit.  The digital readout lets me confirm temp settings with another source and the replaceable sensor means I should be able to keep using these units for a long time.  I found the directions easy to understand, but then again I'm an electrical engineer. I'll probably pick up a couple more to handle ventilation as well."
"589","I own the turn style type of johnson control as well as this one.  While I do like the turn kind and it works well, I like this controller so much better.  I use this for my fermentation chamber when brewing beer and I love the fact that I can set the differential (which I cant on the other controller).  A must have for brewing, lagering, or kegging!"
"590","The use is simple with great instructions. You can control heat or refrigeration with this unit! The quality is fair...not waterproof or anything so treat it with care & protect it from moisture. This product works great with the stopper thermowell. B0064O937C"
"591","I have been looking at sous vide water ovens for years now, but could just not bring myself to spend $500 or more on one. Then I discovered the Johnson Controls Control unit. I paired this unit with the Maxi-Matic MST-800V Elite Gourmet Large 8-1/2-Quart Slow Cooker, a Danesco Roasting Rack - Oval - 6x9 Inch - Non-stick (which fits perfectly in the bottom of the slow cooker, and a Weber 6479 Grill Press (cast iron, but covered in enamel so it won't rust). The grill press is heavy enough to hold the vacuum sealed bag with meat in it down again against the roasting rack. I use a plastic twist tie to attach the temperature probe to the handle of the grill press for accurtate water temp measurement.  The temp. contoller is very easy to change from cooling to heating and directions are easy to understand in the following youtube video: [...]I also purchased the Stainless Steel Toast Rack: B000LWVJHAand the IRIS Stainless Steel Cutting Board Organizer / Napkin HolderThe toast holder or Cutting Board Organizer / Napkin Holder can be wired to the handle of the grill press sitting on the bottom  of the crock pot and used to hold smaller individually sealed pieces of meat or steaks to keep them submerged in the bath and separated.So for a total of $177.18, I got myself, what I think, is a very nice sous vide set up that can be adapted to a variety of sizes and pieces of meat or seafood.Addendum: 7/18/2013Used the sous vide for the first time this weekend and it's performance was stellar. I cooked a plain, old, run of the mill, chuck roast with nothing but salt and pepper on it. I cooked it at 142 degrees for 2 1/2 days. However, next time I need to reduce the temp some. When I took it out it was medium well and I prefer medium rare. It was just pink, but no red juices. I must say though, even though it was done more than I prefer, it was the best roast beef I have ever had, anywhere, anytime. You literally could eat this without teeth it was so tender. I cut mine in pieces and dipped it in steak sauce. It really rivaled a filet mignon. If you have the time and can plan ahead, this is the only way to cook meat. I am going to do a pork loin in the sous vide for pulled pork for a pot luck I have coming up next month."
"592","I got the unwired thermostat cause it was a little cheaper, it was pretty easy to wire for my engineer friend.  The thing does what it's supposed to.  I use it with a cheapo heating pad to keep my carboy warm in my basement.  This summer I'll use it for lagering with a fridge.  If you're a serious homebrewer, you need this."

"598","Been using it for sous-vide cooking and it works like a champ! Highly recommend!"
"599","I bought this product to convert an old chest freezer to a refrigerator that I use to hold five gallon corny kegs containing homebrewed beer.  The unit is truly plug and play and easy to adjust.  Although a little pricier than competing non-digital units in my view it is worth the money to have more precise temperature adjustability."
"600","Works pretty well. No problems yet. Using it to monitor the temp on the freezer out in the garage to brew beer."
"601","This device is a Great helpful controller for freezers. The set up and use is easy and fast.I have used in my freezer for carbonate and I haven't any problem."
"602","Keeps the unit at a beautiful 38C.  It might be causing a slight whine in the compressor?  Unlikely, but I do notice a new whine."

"604","Hooked it up and works wonderfully!"
"605","Worked out great made a small walk in cooler for hanging deer. Bypasted the thermostat plunged unit into plug gets down to 40°"
"606","We ordered this in to regulate our fermentation temps, which is exactly what this bad boy is for.  You can't home brew without this. Brews come out better!!!"
"607","installed on chest freezer to keep homemade beer in set unit installed probe in freezer keeps beer right on temperature cheaper oninitial cost an to run than small frig"
"608","awesome !!"
"609","fast shipping and working good."
"610","I had an old refrigerator that I wanted to store wine in. I put the sensor from this unit into a container of water inside the fridge and it keeps the wine at the perfect temperature."
"611","This was given to me as a Christmas gift without the invoice . When it came time to install it it was noted this is an analog unit and not the one depicted in the photo. Strange Brew was called. Without the invoice number they claim they cant look the sale up. Looking up by name won't work.I was told if I found the invoice to call back. Appears she paid digital price for an analog unit. It is difficult to believe in this age of computers you cant look up a sale by name."
